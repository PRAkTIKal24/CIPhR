Gas Electroluminescence in a Dual Phase Xenon-Doped Argon Detector | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02261v1) | The main physics phenomenon studied is the gas electroluminescence in a dual-phase liquid argon detector with xenon doping. | Yes, this work is related to dark matter searches. The paper states that noble element detectors, like the one studied, are widely used in searches for rare neutrino and dark matter interactions. The study aims to improve the performance of these detectors. | Yes, the paper presents experimental results. The experimental apparatus is described as a 'dual-phase liquid argon detector' but is not given a specific name.
Predicting the single-site and multi-site event discrimination power of dual-phase time projection chambers | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02258v1) | The main focus of this paper is the study and prediction of the event discrimination power of dual-phase xenon time projection chambers (TPCs), specifically their ability to differentiate between single-site (SS) and multi-site (MS) particle interactions. | Yes, this work is related to dark matter searches. It studies the performance of dual-phase xenon TPCs, which are detectors widely used in experiments searching for rare dark matter interactions. The paper aims to improve the ability to distinguish signal from background in these detectors. | No, this paper does not present experimental results. It is a simulation-based study that uses a generic TPC model.
Constraints on New Physics from decays of polarized $Î›_b^0$ baryons at the FCC-ee | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02225v1) | This paper studies the search for sterile neutrinos, which are hypothetical particles proposed to explain neutrino oscillations. The main focus is on a novel deep-learning method using Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to improve the reconstruction of displaced decay vertices, which is a key signature for sterile neutrinos. | Yes, this work is related to dark matter searches. The paper's abstract and introduction explicitly state that sterile neutrinos are a well-motivated dark matter candidate. The search for these particles is therefore a search for a potential component of dark matter. | The paper presents the performance of a new analysis technique on simulated data, not new experimental physics results from recorded data. The work is developed for and based on the Belle II experiment.
The Single-Mass Variable Flavor Number Scheme at Three-Loop Order | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02175v1) | This paper studies the matching relations in the variable flavor number scheme at three-loop order, which describes how massive quarks, like charm and bottom, can be treated as light particles at high energies. It focuses on the theoretical framework for defining heavy-quark parton distributions within protons and other hadrons. | No, this work is not related to dark matter searches. It focuses on the fundamental theory of strong interactions (Quantum Chromodynamics) and the structure of particles within the Standard Model. | No, this paper does not present experimental results. It presents theoretical calculations and numerical results for the matching relations in their theoretical framework.
Wasserstein normalized autoencoder for anomaly detection | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02168v1) | This paper studies dark matter, presenting a new approach for dark matter searches by combining data from multiple detection channels. | Yes, this work is directly related to dark matter searches. It proposes a novel method that uses machine learning to enhance the sensitivity of searches by analyzing combined data from various detection channels. | No, this paper does not present experimental results. The method is applied to simulated data from a future noble liquid detector, not a specific named experimental apparatus.
