Towards the Giant Radio Array for Neutrino Detection (GRAND): the GRANDProto300 and GRAND@Auger prototypes | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21306v1) | The paper studies the resonant conversion of axion-like particles (ALPs) into photons within a microwave cavity in the presence of a strong magnetic field. This is a method used to detect ALPs. | Yes, this work is directly related to dark matter searches. The paper explicitly states that axion-like particles (ALPs) are well-motivated candidates for dark matter, and the experiment is designed to search for them. | Yes, the paper presents experimental results, setting a new limit on the ALP-photon coupling. The paper does not give a specific name to the experimental apparatus, referring to it as 'a new table-top experiment'. The core components are a cryogenic microwave cavity, a 9 T superconducting magnet, and a Josephson parametric amplifier (JPA) detector.
Decaying superfluid turbulence near an anomalous non-thermal fixed point | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21285v1) | This paper is a search for solar axions and other weakly interacting slim particles (WISPs). | Yes, this work is related to dark matter searches. It uses the XENON1T experiment, a dark matter detector, to search for solar axions and other WISPs, which are candidates for dark matter. | Yes, this paper presents experimental results, specifically upper limits on the axion-electron coupling and other particle interactions. The experimental apparatus is named XENON1T.
Probing Light Dark Matter with Cosmic Gravitational Focusing | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21213v1) | The main physics phenomenon studied is Cosmic Gravitational Focusing (CGF) and its application to probe light dark matter. | Yes, this work is directly related to dark matter searches. It proposes using the Cosmic Gravitational Focusing (CGF) effect to detect light dark matter by observing its impact on galaxy formation, which can be measured by galaxy surveys. | No, this paper does not present experimental results. It is a theoretical study that shows the 'projected sensitivity' of a future measurement using the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI).
Radiation of "breathing" vortex electron packets in magnetic field | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21195v1) | The paper studies the radiation from vortex electron packets in a magnetic field and the associated loss of energy and orbital angular momentum. | No, this work is not related to dark matter searches. It focuses on the behavior of vortex electrons in magnetic fields. | No, this paper does not present experimental results. It is a theoretical study where the authors solve Maxwell's equations to calculate the radiated power and angular momentum.
Impact of anisotropy on QCD phase structure and transport coefficients of quark matter | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21186v1) | This paper reviews the experimental techniques for directional recoil detection, which is the study of the directionality of nuclear recoils resulting from particle interactions. | Yes, this work is directly related to dark matter searches. It discusses how detecting the direction of nuclear recoils can be used to confirm that a signal originates from Weakly Interacting Massive Particles (WIMPs), a type of dark matter, by observing a directional dependence linked to the Earth's movement through the galactic dark matter halo. | No, this paper is a review of various experimental techniques and the status of the field. It does not present new experimental results from a specific apparatus. It discusses multiple types of detectors, such as low-pressure gas time projection chambers and nuclear emulsions, rather than focusing on one.
