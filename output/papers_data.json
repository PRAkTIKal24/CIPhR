Its ultimate goal is to provide crucial evidence that addresses the long-standing question of\nthe origin of UHE cosmic rays (UHECRs) [2–4]. GRAND plans to do so, directly, by detecting a\nvast number of UHECRs and, indirectly, by detecting the secondary gamma rays and, especially,\nthe UHE neutrinos made by the interaction of UHECRs [5]. To achieve this, GRAND plans to use\nlarge arrays of radio antennas that search for the distinctive radio signals emitted by the extensive\nair showers initiated by UHE particles interacting in the atmosphere [6, 7].\nThe radio-detection of UHECRs is a mature technique. It has been demonstrated in past\nand present detectors using overground antenna arrays [6, 7] by the Auger Engineering Radio\nArray (AERA) [8], the Low-Frequency Array (LOFAR) [9], the Taiwan Astroparticle Radiowave\nObservatory for Geo-synchrotron Emissions (TAROGE) [10], and the Tianshan Radio Experiment\nfor Neutrino Detection (TREND) [11]; using underground arrays [12] by the Askaryan Radio\nArray (ARA) [13] and the Antarctic Ross Ice Shelf Antenna Neutrino Array (ARIANNA) [14];\n– 1 –GRAND@Auger\n10 antennas\nMalargüe, Argentina\nLook for coincident\ndetection with Auger\nGRAND@Nançay\n4 antennas\nNançay, France\nFor testbenching\nGRANDProto300\n13     65 (now)      300 antennas⇢→\nDunhuang, China\nEstablish efficient autonomous\nradio-detection of air showers\nFigure 1.The GRAND prototype arrays.The three GRAND prototype arrays were deployed in 2023 and\nhave been in operation since.

Concurrent\nwith GRAND, the new Radio Detector of the AugerPrime upgrade [16], the upcoming Payload\nfor Ultrahigh Energy Observations (PUEO) [17], and the proposed next-generation Beamforming\nElevated Array for COsmic Neutrinos (BEACON) [18] and Radar Echo Telescope (RET-CR) [19]\nalso target the radio-detection of UHE particles, though adopting different, complementary [20]\ndetection strategies. References [21–23] present an overview of upcoming UHE detectors.\nBuilding on the experience gained by these experiments—most directly, by AERA and\nTREND—GRANDplanstodeployantennaarraysatalargerscale[1,24]. Thisinvolvesincreasing\nthe number of antennas deployed—to eventually tens of thousands—and deploying them in arrays\nthat are sparser than before—with km-scale antenna separations. This up-scaling is requisite for\nthe antenna arrays to monitor the large volumes of the atmosphere needed to deliver vast numbers\nofdetectedUHECRs[1]andasensitivitytoeventinyfluxesofUHEneutrinos[1,21–23,25]. The\nGRAND Collaboration plans to achieve this while keeping its carbon footprint low [26].\nSuch an enterprise involves facing technical challenges that, while significant, are surmount-\nable. To face them, GRAND is to be built with a staged construction plan [1, 27, 28] designed to\nvalidatethedesignandoperationoftheexperimentinsmallerscalesbeforedeployinglargerarrays.\nFigure 1 shows the locations of the GRAND prototypes, in operation since 2023 [28]:\nGRAND@Nançayin Nançay, France,GRANDProto300[29] in Dunhuang, China, andGRAND\n@Auger[30]inMalargüe,Argentina,atthesiteofthePierreAugerObservatory(PierreAuger)[31].\nTheir purpose is to validate two core requirements that GRAND must fulfill to achieve its goals.\nFirst, the prototypes must validate the viability of autonomous radio-detection of air showers\nin a sparse radio array [32–35], unaided by particle detectors, and despite the presence of natural\nand anthropogenic radio background that may mimic the radio signatures expected from showers.\n– 2 –Second, the prototypes must validate that the arrays are able to operate under harsh environmental\nfield conditions—high temperature, sandstorms, rainstorms—for prolonged periods of time. The\nlessons garnered from the prototypes will inform the design of the experiment in later stages.\nInthispaper,weintroducethedesignandoperationoftheGRANDprototypearrays,focusing\non the two larger ones, GRANDProto300 (GP300) and GRAND@Auger (G@A). In addition,\nwe present the first results obtained by them during their first two years of operation: the time-\ndependent and time-averaged radio spectra measured by them, including identified sources of\nradio background.The ongoing operation of the arrays—though not devoid of challenges—\ncoupled with their early-data results, validate the resilience of the GRAND design to adapt to\ndifferent environmental conditions, a requirement to pursue future, larger stages of GRAND.\nThis constitutes the basis for demonstrating the autonomous detection of cosmic rays in GRAND,\nwhich will be shown in future publications (see Ref. [35] for preliminary results).\nTheremainderofthepaperisorganizedasfollows. Section2introducestheGRANDprototype\narrays, their sites, and layouts. Section 3 describes the GRAND detection unit, its hardware,\nsoftware, and performance. Section 4 presents the self-trigger algorithm of the experiment and\nthe data acquisition software. Section 5 describes the data transfer pipeline, from local and central\nstorage on-site to permanent storage off-site. Section 6 presents the offline data-quality monitoring\ntoolsoftheexperiment. Section7showsthefirstradiospectraobservedbytheGRANDprototypes,\nincluding identified background sources. Section 8 summarizes and concludes.\n2 Overview of the GRAND prototype arrays\nThe site and array layout for each GRAND prototype were decided to fulfill their specific goals:\ntestbenching for GRAND@Nançay, demonstrating the autonomous radio-detection of air showers\nfor GP300, and observing coincident detection of air showers with the Pierre Auger detectors in\nG@A.Theradiobackgroundvariesbetweensites,withthebackgroundatGRAND@Nançaybeing\nthe loudest, and the background at GP300 being appreciably smaller than at G@A, predominantly\ndue to GP300 being farther from human activity.\nGRAND@Nançay.—GRAND@NançayisasmallarrayoffourGRANDdetectionunits(DUs,\nSection 3) located at the Nançay Radio Observatory, in France. It was conceived as a field site\naccessibletoEuropeanlaboratories,facilitatingtestbenchingofequipmentandnewideasindesign,\ntrigger, and data acquisition. The design of GRAND@Nançay resembles that of the other two\nprototype arrays, though with notable differences, such as having antennas of lower height and\ncommunications via optical fiber instead of wireless. Due to its small size, it serves primarily as a\ntestbed. In the remainder of the paper, we focus on GRANDProto300 and GRAND@Auger.\nGRANDProto300.—GP300 is the pathfinder array for GRAND in the Northern Hemisphere.\nIn its final stage, it will be a 300-antenna array; presently, it exists in partial configurations.\nThe 300-antenna stage of GP300 will span an area of about 200 km2 in the Gobi Desert near\nXiaodushan, in northern Dunhuang, China, making it the largest of the three prototypes. The site\nis a largely radio-quiet region in the 50–200 MHz radio-frequency band, which GRAND adopts as\nits working frequency band. The precise location was chosen after a survey of regions that contain\na relatively flat area capable of hosting the final 300-antenna stage of GP300, and that was located\n– 3 –□4000 □3000 □2000 □1000 0 1000 2000\nx [m]\n□2000\n□1000\n0\n1000\n2000\n3000\n4000\n5000\ny [m]\n10\n1\n8\n11\n6\n2\n9\n12\n3\n7\n4\n5\n13\n119\n116\n106\n93\n102\n91\n81\n78\n88\n47\n44\n85\n43\n37\n40\n82\n55\n31\n28\n52\n15\n20\n23\n35\n11\n8\n32\n48\n19\n51\n7\n16\n5\n27\n2\n24\n13\n39\n1\n12\n38\n4\n3\n25\n26\n50\n18\n49\n6\n17\n10\n9\n33\n34\n22\n14\n21\n54\n30\n29\n53\n42\n36\n41\n46\n45\nCS1\nCS2\nCS: Central Station\nGRANDProto300\ndetection units\nGP300 s65 (Apr 25–present)\nGP300 s13 (Jun 23–Apr 25)\n□26000 □25500 □25000 □24500\nx [m]\n14600\n14800\n15000\n15200\n15400\n15600\n15800\n16000\nCRS\n35 36\n135\n44\n5\n9\n25\n27\n82\n136 137\n146145\n152\n85 157\n58\n49\n69\n59\n83\n70\n144\n60\n84\n151\nAccess road\nCRS: Central Radio Station\nGRAND@Auger detection unit\nAERA station\nN\nFigure 2.Array layout of GRANDProto300 (left) and of GRAND@Auger (right).Each GRAND\ndetection unit (DU) has an assigned identification number.

For GRANDProto300, the DUs from the 13-antenna stage, GP300_s13, were repositioned as\npart of the 65-antenna stage, GP300_s65, in May of 2025, and the original Central Station 1 (CS1) was\nreplacedbythenewCS2.

By April of 2025, the array was extended to its current\n65-antenna stage, GP300_s65, which has been operating since and whose additional goals include\ntesting the efficiency and purity of the detection of inclined air showers from UHECRs. GP300,\neven in partial configuration, is expected to detect UHECRs with energies between 100PeV and a\nfew EeV, probing the Galactic to extragalactic transition region of cosmic ray origin.\nFigure2showsthelayoutofGP300_s13andGP300_s65.

A hexagonal array has fewer\ndirections along which the performance of shower-reconstruction methods is degraded as a result\nof the shower trajectory being aligned with the axes of symmetry of the array layout.\nGP300_s13 had a three-hexagon layout, covering an area of about 2 km2 with a DU spacing\nof about 500 m. The Central Station 1 (CS1) was built north-west of the array; it consisted of\nthree sets of container rooms that stored the central data acquisition (DAQ) computer and the\nlodgingandcookingfacilities.

The array has a dense region to the east with a DU\nspacing of 577 m and a sparse region to the west with a spacing of 1000 m. A new Central Station\n(CS2) was built for GP300_s65 and placed at its center.\nPreliminary simulations [37] estimate that the full GP300 array may detect about 130 inclined\ncosmic-rayeventsperday—foranideal100%uptimeofthedetector—intheenergyrangeof10 17–\n1020 eV, reaching a trigger efficiency of 90% already at1018.3 eV.

Although the search for these cosmic rays is\ncomplicated by firmware and DAQ changes made during prototype testing, it has already yielded\nits first likely candidates in GP300_s65 data [38–40].\nGRAND@Auger.—G@A results from an agreement between the GRAND and Pierre Auger\nCollaborations to repurpose 10 AERA radio-stations in Malargüe, Argentina, into GRAND DUs.\nThedeploymentofG@AwascompletedinAugustof2023andithasbeenoperatingsince. Because\nG@AisembeddedwithintheregionofthePierreAugerdetectorarray,itoffers,uniquelyamongthe\nthree prototypes, the opportunity to validate the radio-detection—and ensuing reconstruction—of\nairshowersthataresimultaneouslydetectedbyG@AandbythePierreAugersurfacedetector(SD)\narray of water-Cherenkov particle detectors, fluorescence telescopes, and radio antennas, the latter\nrecently deployed [16].\nFigure 2, right, shows the layout of G@A, deployed within the AERA array, itself located\nwithin the Pierre Auger 750-m SD array, and within the field of view of the Coihueco and HEAT\nfluorescence detectors [44, 45]. Ten of the AERA Phase-2 stations were modified into GRAND\nDUs. The DUs are laid on two superimposed hexagons with a predominant spacing of 250 m,\ncovering an area of 0.5 km2. The G@A central DAQ computer is located in the AERA Central\nRadio Station (CRS). Nearby roads facilitate access to the site.\nFor G@A, using a denser detector layout enhances the detection of less energetic and less\ninclined events. The estimated event rate for the Pierre Auger 750-m SD array is390±17showers\nperdayover25km 2 [46].

This leads to weaker signals in the antennas, making it generally\nmore challenging to detect showers in G@A.\n3 The GRAND detection unit\nThe GRAND detection unit (DU) consists of an antenna—theHorizonAntenna—and the elec-\ntronics to process, store, and communicate the signals detected.

During their deployment and commissioning, different configurations of the hardware and\nsoftware were installed at each array for two reasons. First, adapting the instrumentation was\nnecessary for the setups to operate under the different environmental conditions present at each\nsite.

In the following sections, we discuss the\ncharacteristics of the antenna, LNAs, the GRAND FEB, power supply, and communications setup.\n3.2 Antenna and low-noise amplifier\nAntenna.—Figure 5, left, shows that the antenna itself consists of five arms: two dipoles in the\nNorth-South and East-West directions, and a monopole in the vertical direction. The dipole size is\nroughly 1.4 m, to match the GRAND working frequency band of 50–200 MHz. Figure 5, right,\nshows the acrylic nut with an internal connector to which the antenna arms are attached. The LNA\nboard is housed in the metal base of the nut and is powered by a coaxial cable that also transports\nreceived signals to the FEB.\nFigure6showsthesimulatedresponseoftheGRANDHorizonAntennatoanincomingradio\nsignal, expressed in the form of the magnitude of the vector effective length (VEL),Leff.

[48].\nFor theHorizonAntenna, the VEL was simulated using the Ansys HFSS (high-frequency\nstructure simulator) program, with a setup that included the complete mechanical structure of the\nDU. The resulting VEL is an elaborate function of frequency, zenith, and azimuth angle that fully\ncharacterizes the response of the antenna to an arbitrary incoming plane-wave signal; see Fig. 5\nin Ref. [48]. This is an essential ingredient to produce simulated measurements and interpret real\nones.

Given the complexity of the VEL of theHorizonAntenna, its validation in\nthe field remains to be completed; a calibration campaign is planned to verify our simulations.\nFigure7showsthegroupdelayoftheHorizonAntenna,i.e.,thederivativewithrespecttothe\nfrequencyofthephaseshiftofthetransferfunctionoftheDU(Section3.4). Avaryinggroupdelay\nthroughout the working frequency range can lead to signal dispersion and loss of amplitude due to\ninterference effects. For air-shower detection and reconstruction, the shape and amplitude of the\nsignal areimportant assetsused, for example, in triggeringalgorithms. For theHorizonAntenna,\n– 9 –Figure 9.Low-noise amplifier (LNA) board deployed at GRANDProto300 (left) and GRAND@Auger\n(right).The main components of the boards are: (1) connectors to the antenna, (2) balun, (3) matching\nnetwork, (4) amplifier, and (5) power. Although the components are in similar locations, their specifications\nare not the same in both boards. See Section 3.2 for details.\nthe group delay is nearly flat in frequency for the three antenna arms, with differences well below\n20 ns that do not significantly distort the expected pulse shape. Given the frequency bandwidth of\n200 MHz, group delay variations smaller than its inverse (5 ns) are acceptable. While there are\nsharp peaksin thegroup delay, they arenarrow enough tohave onlya small effecton signalpower.\nThe antenna responseis embedded in theGRANDlibprocessing pipeline [48] (Section 3.4) andis\nused in the reconstruction of the properties of showers detected by GRAND.\nFigure8showsthegainoftheHorizonAntenna,i.e.,theratiobetweenthepowertransmitted\ntotheantennafeedpointbyasignalcomingfromonespecificdirection(𝜃, 𝜙)andthesamequantity\naveraged over all directions.

Thesetwoarmsexhibit\nsimilarbehavior,withanenhancedsensitivitybelow100MHz,wheremostoftheradiosignalfrom\nEAS is expected, for zenith angles of 60–75◦. At a zenith angle of85◦—closer to the ground—the\ngain remains close to unity for a large part of the 50–200MHz bandwidth, despite stronger ground\nattenuation. The slight difference between the X and Y arms is due to the influence of the solar\npanel placed at the foot of the antenna. Here again, like in Figs. 6 and 7, the Z arm exhibits a\ndifferent behavior, with a gain increasing with zenith angle, as expected, but also with frequency, a\nfeature we understand as a consequence of ground reflections.\nLNA.—Figure 9 shows the two designs of the LNA boards deployed in GP300 and G@A.\nFor GP300, the LNA board was designed to provide a stable gain of about 20 dB in the range of\n50–200 MHz. As shown in Fig. 9, left, in the GP300 board the X and Y paths are connected to the\n– 10 –dipoles and the Z path, to the monopole. When powered with 5 V from the FEB (more on it later),\nthe LNA board draws 47 mA for each channel, leading to a power consumption of about 235 mW\nforthefullboard. AnelectrostaticdischargeprotectionstructureguardstheLNAfromdamagedue\nto static electricity. The balun converts differential signals into single-ended signals and performs\nimpedance transformation. The matching network, located at the front-end of the LNA, converts\nthe impedance to 50Ω, minimizing impedance matching issues at the LNA input port.\nForG@A,theLNAdesignwasfocusedonprovidinghighergainatalowpowerconsumption.\nOur design provides a stable gain of about 30 dB for each of the X, Y, Z channels, in the same\nrange as GP300, 50–200 MHz. The noisier radio environment of G@A compared to GP300 leads\ntoadditionalnoisepickup. Wereitnotforthehigh-gainLNA,thisnoisewouldbeamplifiedbythe\nvariable gain amplifier on the FEB. Like in GP300, the board is powered with 5 V by the GRAND\nFEB; each channel draws 40 mA and the total power consumption of the board is 200 mW. As\nshown in Fig. 9, right, the path lengths for the X, Y, and Z channels in the LNA board are exactly\nthe same, leading to equal signal time delays for all channels. This allows for the study of the\ntime dependence of the polarization in an unbiased way, avoiding additional software corrections\nto the timing of the individual polarization directions. Given the weather conditions in Argentina,\nwe implemented moisture countermeasures to prevent water damage: the nuts are sealed with an\nadditional layer of silicone, and the LNA boards are coated with transparent lacquer.\nThe main differences in the output signals provided by the two designs of the LNA board are\nthe gain and the matching network. For GP300, the LNA has uniform matching across the full\nfrequency range. For G@A model, its matching is optimized for higher frequencies,i.e., above 80\nMHz. The difference in maximum gain for the LNA boards is compensated by the amplifier in the\nGRAND FEB, as described in the next section.\n3.3 Front-end board and firmware\nFigure 10 shows the prototype GRAND FEB used in GP300 and G@A. We describe its primary\ncomponents we below.\nAnalog chain.—The analog chain, component (1) in Fig. 10, serves multiple purposes. First,\nthe analog signals, coming from the LNA, are shaped through a fifth-order elliptical 30–200MHz-\nbandpassfilter. Inthefollowing,theypassthroughthevariablegainamplifier(VGA),whosesetting\niscontrolledbythedigitalpartoftheboard. Thegaincanvarybetween-10and+20dB.InGP300,\nwe use a VGA gain of 20dB; in G@A, we use a 0dB gain. In addition, the analog chain supplies\npower to the front-end LNA boards (Section 3.2) through a bias-T.\nFigure11showsthemeasuredanalogresponseoftheFEBboard. Forthisfigure,theVGAgain\nof the FEB was set at 3 dB before the measurement. The response was then measured to be nearly\nconstant in the GRAND working frequency range of 50–200 MHz, with a value of approximately\n3 dB, indicating that the signal is amplified properly.\nADC chip.—The FEBs digitize the signals after they pass the analog chain. The digitization\nuses a 14-bit 500MSPS, 4-channel analog-to-digital converter (ADC; Analog Devices, AD9694),\ncomponent (2) in Fig. 10, in differential mode with an input voltage range of±0.9V. This setting\nallows us to measure the background noise at around 30 ADC counts, leaving a dynamic range\nof about 9 effective bits. This yields a compromise between accurate noise determination and\n– 11 –Figure 10.The GRAND front-end board (FEB).The main components: (1) signal input and filter chain,\nwith four inputs available; (2) analog-to-digital (ADC) chip; (3) system on chip: field-programmable gate\narray (FPGA) and central processing unit (CPU) ; (4) Global Positioning System (GPS) chip and connector;\n(5)Ethernetchip;(6)clock;(7)powersupplyforthedigitalpartoftheboard;(8)powersupplyfortheanalog\npart of the board; and (9) power connector and switch.

Triggering is elaborated on in in Section 4.\nGPSandslowcontrolparameters.—Aftertriggering,thefirmwarebuildstheevent. Datafrom\nthe three input channels are combined with timing information from the GPS chip (Trimble RES\nSMT360), component (4) in Fig.10, and data from slow control parameters, such as air pressure\nand battery voltage. These are written in an event header, in which all configuration parameters\nare also stored. The local software inside the CPU is notified that an event is present and starts the\ntransfer into the local board memory.\nTriggeringanddatatransfer.—Twofirmwareversionsweretested,oneatGP300andtheother\natG@A.Theydifferinthemethodofdatatransferintomemory.

Given the quieter radio environment\nof GP300, the AXI speed is enough to deal with the trigger rate.\nHowever, the higher trigger rate at the G@A site required a faster memory transfer method.\nTherefore, at G@A, the software uses direct memory access (DMA transfer), moving all parts of\neach triggered event into double data rate (DDR) memory, which has a total size of 512MB. The\nfirmware may then apply a secondary “high-level” trigger algorithm to further reject uninteresting\nevents.

The RF chain receives as input an open-circuit voltage,𝑉oc, which\nemulates the output voltage from the antenna arms. The final output voltage ofGRANDlib,𝑉out,\nis the resulting signal after passing through the matching network, LNA, cables, connectors, and\nFEB. Reference [48] contains more details ofGRANDlib, the RF chain, and its implementation.\nThe implementation of the RF chain inGRANDlibis modular and can be adapted to the\ndifferent setups of GP300 and G@A. The RF chain is described viascattering parameters(S-\nparameters), which quantify the reflection and transmission of the signals as they travel through\nthe different components of a GRAND DU. The S-parameters of GP300 and G@A were measured\nseparately in the laboratory and fed toGRANDlib.\nFigure12showstheresultingsimulatedoverallsystemresponseasafunctionoffrequencyfor\nGP300andG@A.Theresponseisquantifiedviathetransferfunction,definedastheratio𝑉 out/𝑉oc,\n– 14 –measuredwithrespecttothebaseoftheDU(seealsoFig.8inRef.[48]). WithinGP300andG@A,\nthe transfer functions of the X and Y arms are similar to each other and different from the transfer\nfunction of the Z arm, reflecting their VELs (Fig. 6). However, the transfer functions are different\nin GP300 and G@A, primarily because of their different LNAs. Although refinement of the RF\nchain is still ongoing, the results in Fig. 12 already allow us to validate the setups by comparing\nsimulations to measurements of, for example, the Galactic radio background [29].\n3.5 Communications and power supply\nCommunication between the local and central DAQ software is done through TCP/IP sockets for\nboth G@A and GP300. Upon request from the central DAQ, the complete event is sent over the\nwireless network. This network is created through M5 (G@A) or AirMax (GP300)™Ubiquiti\nBullets, Rockets, and a parabolic communications antenna. For G@A these were provided by the\nPierre Auger Collaboration. Bi-directional transmission tests were performed point-to-point,i.e.,\nDU to DAQ, in both arrays, using a fixed file size. The uplink speed, from DU to DAQ, was on\naverage 2.9 MB s−1 for GP300 and 2.1 MB s−1 for G@A. The downlink speed, from DAQ to\nDU, was on average 4.2 MB s−1 for GP300 and 1.1 MB s−1 for G@A. The local and central DAQ\nsoftware pipeline is described in the next section.\nIn both arrays, the power supply of each DU consists of a solar panel, a charge controller, and\na battery. The power consumption of a single DU is roughly 15W. The power supply components\nwerespecifiedtoensuretheDUscanoperateforoneweekonafullbattery,evenwithoutinputfrom\nthesolarpanel. InGP300,thesolarpanelshaveanominalpowerof180W,withamaximumpower\nvoltageof19.5V.Low-noisechargecontrollers(GenasunGV-10-Pb-12V)werechosentoefficiently\ncharge the battery from the solar panel as well as provide power to the FEBs. Cold-resistant gel\nbatteries were selected, operating at a nominal output voltage of 12V with a capacity of 200Ah.\nIn G@A, the AERA electronics compartment and power harvesting were mostly re-used, as\nthe power requirements of the prototype GRAND FEB match the AERA electronics quite closely.\nThesolarpanelwasthesameoriginallydeployedintheAERA-IIstations(Kyocera135W),witha\nnominalpowerof135Wandmaximumoutputvoltageof16V.Newchargecontrollers,ofthesame\nmodelasdeployedatGP300,wereinstalledtoreplacetheoriginalAERAones. Thebatterieswere\nalso exchanged for lead-acid batteries with a nominal output voltage of 12V and 180Ah capacity.\nOverall, the final power supply for G@A has a smaller capacity than for GP300. As a result, G@A\nDUs may need to hibernate during Argentinian winters, depending on their battery levels.\nIn GP300 and G@A, the charge controllers are housed in Faraday cages. To further isolate\nthem from electromagnetic noise, a filter (Spectrum Control 1250-054) was added to the output\nof the charge controller. The Bullet is also housed in the FEB box at G@A, and, due to the\nheat-dissipation modifications, in a separate Faraday cage at GP300.\n4 Self-trigger and data acquisition\n4.1 Self-trigger algorithm\nThe main science case of GRAND—the study of ultra-high-energy particles [1]—involves the\ndetection of extensive air showers. The radio emission from air showers induces a temporary\n– 15 –Figure13.LocalTriggerflowforanincomingsignalataGRANDdetectionunit.Thetriggeralgorithm\nstarts when the amplitude of the signal exceeds the preset “signal threshold\",i.e., when a signal crossing\nhappens, as long as there was no such crossing in the preceding quiet time window. In the time period\nfollowing the signal crossing, called the “trigger period window”, the algorithm counts the number of\ncrossings of a lower “noise threshold\". If the number of noise-threshold crossings is between predefined\nallowed minimum and maximum values, and the time interval between any two adjacent noise-threshold\ncrossings does not exceed a predefined maximum value, the trigger process is completed and the signal is\naccepted. Because the trigger logic runs under the 500-MHz clock in the FPGA, the timing has a resolution\nof 2 ns. The time stamp, corresponding to the time of the end of the trigger period window, is recorded and\nit is sent to the Central DAQ.\ndistortion of the local electric field, with a duration of several nanoseconds. Through the data\nacquisition chain described above, this distortion is translated into a short transient in the voltage\ninputtotheADC.However,anthropogenicsourcesalsoemitradiopulseswithsimilarcharacteristics.\nThus, air-shower experiments that rely solely on their radio-detection, like the GRAND prototype\narrays, must have a self-triggering procedure that selects only detected events that resemble those\nexpected from air showers.\nThe detected radio pulse emitted by an air shower generates a short-duration, high-amplitude\n(relative to the average baseline) oscillation in the FEB output. Man-made noise usually creates\na wider pulse or a train of pulses. In addition, constructive interference of single-frequency\nanthropogenic sources can also create air shower-like pulses. The Local Trigger happens at the\nDU level and is implemented within the firmware running on the FPGA chip. Its aim is to select\nair-shower candidates while rejecting background pulses by efficiently identifying peaks in the\ndifferenceoftwoconsecutiveADCsamples. WiththeprototypeGRANDFEB,itispossibletofirst\nremove single-frequency noise sources with a digital filter, as shown in Section 3.3. The resulting\nfiltered signal is fed to the trigger algorithm.\nFigure 13 shows a representative flowchart of the trigger algorithm, which begins with a\nconfigurable “signal threshold”. If the signal exceeds this threshold and there has not been any\nthreshold crossing in a time window prior to the current pulse, the algorithm starts. The signal\n– 16 –threshold is set to a value that is suitably higher than the average noise level, while maintaining a\nreasonable trigger rate. The second of these conditions aims to avoid pulse trains. Next, in a time\nwindow after the pulse, the system counts how many times a second “noise threshold” is crossed.\nThe width of the time windows, the signal and noise threshold levels, the allowed maximum\nnumber of crossings of the noise threshold, and the maximum time between successive crossings\nare adjustable parameters. They are set offline at the Central DAQ prior to each data acquisition\nrun. The values are chosen to best reject long and/or irregular pulse trains, and to prevent digital\nglitchesfromcorruptingthevoltagetraces. Thistriggerflexibilityallowsustoadapttothedifferent\nnoise environments of each array, with G@A requiring stricter settings to avoid the more frequent\nnarrow and broadband radio frequency interference (RFI). When all triggering conditions are met,\nthe Local Trigger is complete and the timestamp is sent to the Central DAQ.\nNext to recording air showers, the arrays also keep track of the background conditions via\nunbiasedtriggering. This corresponds to periodically recorded data, independent of the measured\nvoltage levels. Such unbiased data are suitable for monitoring the environment and for calibrating\nthe setups using the periodic variation of the Galactic noise, which is currently ongoing [30, 36].\nUnbiased data can also be used for additional science cases like measuring fast radio bursts [48].\nUnbiased triggering, by default, takes place once every 10 s (a pre-defined 20-Hz mode is also\navailable). In the G@A firmware version, it is possible to set the unbiased triggering frequency\nbetween 1Hz and 100kHz. GP300 and G@A perform both transient and unbiased triggering.\nAchievingahighself-triggerperformanceiskeytothesuccessofastandaloneradio-detection\nexperimentsuchasGRAND.Theachievedtriggerrateasafunctionoftheincomingrateoftransient\npulses is of particular importance.

Unbiased triggered events bypass the Local Trigger at the\nFPGA but still go through the same DAQ pipeline. See Section 4 for details.\nanditsevent-buildingprocess. Thisprocesscombinesallinformationintoasingleeventandwrites\nthe data to the local disk. All coincident transient triggered data that satisfy the Central Trigger are\nrecorded incoincident data(CD) binary files.\nFurthermore, a random selection of local transient triggered events can be promoted to a\nCentral Trigger and be saved as well. These events have no coincidences with other DUs and are\nusedtomonitorthetriggeralgorithmandthenoiseenvironment. Theyarestoredseparatelyinunit\ndata(UD) binary files. Unbiased triggers are always promoted to Central triggers and are saved in\nmonitoringdata (MD) files.\n5 Data storage\nThe final data files of each trigger type—CD, UD, and MD—are saved on the local storage of the\nCentral DAQ computer in GP300 and G@A. For GP300, the binary files are sent in real time to a\ncomputercenterinNanjing,China,throughawirelessbridge. Thefilesarethenmanuallymovedto\nthe CC-IN2P3 cluster in Lyon, France. For G@A, new files on disk are copied daily to the central\nstorage in CC-IN2P3 using the 4G network. This copying does not interfere with the data-taking\nor the bandwidth used by the Pierre Auger Collaboration. In case of high RFI conditions or failed\noff-site data transfer, the DAQ computer has enough memory to store all data.\nThe automatic copying requires a local bash script to run automatically (i.e., acronjob) on\nthe central computer for G@A and semi-manually for GP300. This script first searches for files\nnot already transferred to CC-IN2P3 and stores this list in a simple local SQLite database. This\n– 18 –database is used to keep track of previously transferred files and to determine if a file needs to be\nsent. Afterwards,thenewdatafilesarerelayedtothecorrespondingdirectoriesonCC-IN2P3using\nrsyncand then flagged into the local SQLite database.\nWhen data dispatch is finalized, a second script is triggered in CC-IN2P3 that registers all\nnewly transferred files in the main database and launches the conversion into the GRANDRoot\nformat, described in Ref. [48]. The GRANDRoot files are moved to the corresponding directories\nand registered in the main database.\n6 Data quality monitoring\nTo ensure adequate data quality during the deployment and commissioning phases of GP300 and\nG@A,afewkeyparametersaretrackedineveryDU.Aspreviouslystated,acompleteeventconsists\nofthetriggeredADCtimetracesandtheslowcontrolparameters,likethebatterylevelattheboard\ninput, the GPS, and, in G@A alone, the ADC and FPGA chip temperatures and the trigger rate.\nThrough the unbiased triggered data, these parameters can be continuously monitored. Their\nbehaviorwasusednotonlytocommissionthearraysbutalsotovalidatethefirmwareandthelocal\nand central DAQ software. Other features—such as their root mean square (RMS), fast Fourier\ntransform, and power spectral densities (PSDs)—are extracted from the ADC traces in the time\ndomain to monitor day-night effects and detect local radio transients. Particularly, the PSDs can\nbe used to characterize the environment radio background, the electronic noise self-induced by the\nsetup, the Galactic radio background, and the RFI. These parameters are checked daily to ensure\noptimal operation of the setups. We monitor their behavior over time, comparing them between\nDUs to achieve consistent data quality across the array.\nThe commissioning is facilitated by a data monitoring web page. The page is updated daily at\n05:00CET,byacrontabjobthatrunsaseriesofscriptsatCC-IN2P3onthedatafrombotharrays.\nThe DU uptime, the mean RMS of the last 24 hours of traces, battery levels, and temperatures\nare tracked as a function of time. Averaged PSDs are also displayed for easy comparison between\nchannels and between DUs. The page also stores the averages over the last 7 days and the last 30\ndays. There is flexibility to present the data of all DUs together or of only the desired ones.\n7 First results\nGP300andG@Ahaveoperatedforabouttwoyearssincetheendoftheirdeployment(withGP300\nchanging from comprising 13 to 65 DUs). Throughout this period, enough unbiased triggered data\nwascollectedtocharacterizetheperformanceoftheDUsandthelocalelectromagneticenvironment.\nThese studies were performed in the frequency domain, where the complete antenna readout chain\nisbetterunderstoodandbackgroundsourcescanbeidentified. Inaddition,astheDUsaredeployed\nrelatively close together, working in the frequency domain allowed us to verify that all of them\nshowed similar response, which is needed to understand the relative calibration between DUs.\nFigure 15 shows spectrograms generated using data collected by two DUs, one from GP300\nandonefromG@A,overaperiodofaboutnineandthirteendays,respectively. Thesespectrograms\nare representative of the standard behavior of all DUs in their respective arrays.\n– 19 –Power spectrum density [mV² MHz⁻¹]\n10⁻⁴ 10⁻³ 10⁻² 10⁻¹ 10⁰ 10¹ 10² 10³\nGRAND@AugerGRANDProto300\nNorth-South\nEast-West\nVertical\nNorth-South\nEast-West\nVertical\nFigure 15.Spectrograms measured by GRAND detection units.Each row shows spectrograms for a dif-\nferent antenna polarization: North-South (top), East-West (center), and vertical (bottom).

Of the intermittent contributions,\none at around 70 MHz can be seen in all polarizations, where there is an increase of amplitude for\na few hours with no clear periodicity. In the North-South polarization, the four lines within 60–80\nMHz correspond to the known emission of the AERA beacon, set up at the CRS (see Fig. 2).\nIn Fig. 15, the white horizontal lines represent periods of DU hibernation, after which data\nacquisition resumes autonomously once the conditions are appropriate. The G@A DU had more\nhibernation periods than the GP300 DU, a reflection of the harsher environment in Argentina,\nleading to more periods with insufficient sunlight to power the batteries and more instances of\noverheating. In general, the radio environment at GP300 is considerably quieter than at G@A,\nbut wide background-free frequency bands exist at both sites. Nevertheless, the background in\nseveral frequency ranges is substantial and can negatively influence the self-trigger capabilities of\nthe system, especially in G@A.\nFigure 16 shows the time-averaged PSDs of GP300 and G@A, where the background noise\n– 21 –contributions can be more clearly seen. For GP300, the PSD is mostly free of peaks, except in the\n118–140MHzrange—inagreementwithFig.15—wheretherearestrongcontributionsfromplane\nandsatellitecommunications.

In particular, the G@A PSD characterizes the electromagnetic background at the Pierre\nAuger site at frequencies much higher than either AERA or the Auger Radio Detector are capable\nof measuring. This can aid and complement analyses of the Pierre Auger Collaboration—another\nexample of the synergy between the Pierre Auger Observatory and GRAND.\nFigures 15 and 16 show that, while radio background is unavoidable in both arrays, it is\nlocalized within frequency ranges that can be isolated and masked out in specific analyses. For\ninstance,searchesforthediffuseGalacticradioemissionrequirenoise-freefrequencyranges,dueto\ntheloweremissionamplitudeofthisbackgroundcomparedtoartificialradiosources. Thissearchis\nongoing in both prototype arrays [29, 30], since it presents an opportunity for detector calibration.\nThe above results show that the radio background at both sites is understood. At the GP300\nsite, there are fewer RFI sources compared to the G@A site. The baseline levels of the PSDs are\nthe same for both prototype arrays, around10−2 mV2 MHz−1. In summary, early data from the\nGRAND prototype arrays already validate their usefulness: that,despite differences in hardware\nand software, the overall response of the GRAND DU is consistent regardless of the deployment\nsite.This is a structural finding for future cross-calibration runs and for the later stages of the\nexperiment, which envision two or more 10,000-DU arrays deployed at different geographical\nlocations, and whose data will be analyzed jointly.\n8 Summary and perspectives\nThe Giant Radio Array for Neutrino Detection (GRAND) is a planned observatory of ultra-high-\nenergy particles of cosmic origin: cosmic rays, neutrinos, and gamma rays. GRAND aims to\ndetect the radio emission from air showers initiated by their interaction in the atmosphere using\nlarge ground arrays of antennas. The next large deployment goal of GRAND is to have two arrays\nconsistingof10,000antennaseachintheNorthernandSouthernHemispheres. Toachievethis,the\nGRANDCollaborationhasadoptedastagedapproachtodeployment,withthreeongoingprototype\narrays to test and validate the detection and reconstruction methods.\nThree prototype arrays were deployed in 2023. GRAND@Nançay, in France, is a 4-antenna\narrayusedasatestbenchfortheCollaboration’sEuropeanlaboratories. GRANDProto300,inChina,\nhasgonethroughtwostagesofdeployment,fromaninitial13-antennastagetoitscurrent65-antenna\nstage. These stages act as pathfinders for the future final 300-antenna array. GRAND@Auger, in\nArgentina, stems from an agreement between the GRAND and the Pierre Auger Collaborations.\nThe 10-antenna array was deployed on modified AERA stations. In this paper, we focused on the\nhardware, software, and early operation of GRANDProto300 and GRAND@Auger.\nTo adapt to local conditions and explore optimal designs for the final GRAND setup, the\nprototype array at each site featured different key choices in hardware and software. Throughout\n2023, the arrays, including their hardware, firmware, and DAQ software, were commissioned\nusing daily data monitoring. Operating these prototypes under prolonged field conditions exposed\nhardware and software challenges that have been met.\n– 23 –GRANDProto300andGRAND@Augerhaveremainedlargelyoperationalforabouttwoyears.\nTheir data have been analyzed and understood. We have shown results based on these data that\ndemonstrate the adequacy of the GRAND experimental setup and provide an understanding of the\nradiobackgroundpresentateachsite. ThedetectionoftheGalacticradioemission—thesearchfor\nwhich is ongoing in both prototypes—will refine the calibration of the GRAND detection units.\nTheGRANDprototypeshavealreadyyieldedakeyresult: thattheperformanceoftheGRAND\ndetection units is similar at the two array sites, despite one having a radio background notably\nhigher than the other, and despite their differences in hardware and software. The demonstrated\nresilience of the GRAND DU is not merely a technical achievement; it is a foundational scientific\nresult for the entire project. A future stage of GRAND consisting of arrays distributed in multiple\ngeographicallocationswillinevitablyfacediverseenvironmentalandradio-backgroundconditions.\nOur finding that consistent performance can be achieved through adaptable hardware and software\nconfirms the feasibility of combining data from geographically distant arrays. This is essential for\nachieving the full-sky coverage and large-scale exposure of future stages of GRAND.\nThe ultimate goal of GRANDProto300 and GRAND@Auger is to validate the autonomous\nradio-detection of inclined extensive air showers in GRAND, expected from ultra-high-energy\ncosmic rays, neutrinos, and gamma rays. This detection, triggered by no signal other than radio,\nand with a high efficiency, is essential to the goals of GRAND. Presently, the data collected by\nGRANDProto300 and GRAND@Auger are being searched for air showers initiated by ultra-high-\nenergy cosmic rays. In GRANDProto300, we have identified the first cosmic-ray candidates [38–\n43]. In GRAND@Auger, the detection of cosmic-ray candidates is being validated through their\ncoincident detection by the Pierre Auger Observatory [47].\nAcknowledgments\nThe GRAND Collaboration acknowledges the significant contributions to this manuscript of Beat-\nriz de Errico, for her work on data management and analysis, site survey and construction, DAQ\nsoftwaredebugging,manuscriptwriting,andfigurepreparation;andofShenWang,forhisworkon\nGP300sitesurveyandconstruction,hardwareverification,andmanuscriptplanningandwriting.

    "combined_content": "Abstract Content:\nThe Giant Radio Array for Neutrino Detection (GRAND) is a proposed\nmulti-messenger observatory of ultra-high-energy (UHE) particles of cosmic\norigin. Its main goal is to find the long-sought origin of UHE cosmic rays by\ndetecting large numbers of them and the secondary particles created by their\ninteraction -- gamma rays, and, especially, neutrinos. GRAND will do so using\nlarge arrays of radio antennas that look for the radio signals emitted by the\nair showers initiated by the interactions of the UHE particles in the\natmosphere. Since 2023, three small-scale prototype GRAND arrays have been in\noperation: GRAND@Nan\\c{c}ay in France, GRAND@Auger in Argentina, and\nGRANDProto300 in China. Together, their goal is to validate the detection\nprinciple of GRAND under prolonged field conditions, achieving efficient,\nautonomous radio-detection of air showers. We describe the hardware, software,\nlayout, and operation of the GRAND prototypes and show the first radio spectra\nmeasured by them. Despite challenges, the successful operation of the\nprototypes confirms that the GRAND instrumentation is apt to address the goals\nof the experiment and lays the groundwork for its ensuing stages.\n\nPDF Content:\nPrepared for submission to JINST\nTowards the Giant Radio Array for Neutrino Detection\n(GRAND): the GRANDProto300 and GRAND@Auger\nprototypes\nGR D\nN\nGRAND Collaboration\nJ.

Its ultimate goal is to provide crucial evidence that addresses the long-standing question of\nthe origin of UHE cosmic rays (UHECRs) [2–4]. GRAND plans to do so, directly, by detecting a\nvast number of UHECRs and, indirectly, by detecting the secondary gamma rays and, especially,\nthe UHE neutrinos made by the interaction of UHECRs [5]. To achieve this, GRAND plans to use\nlarge arrays of radio antennas that search for the distinctive radio signals emitted by the extensive\nair showers initiated by UHE particles interacting in the atmosphere [6, 7].\nThe radio-detection of UHECRs is a mature technique. It has been demonstrated in past\nand present detectors using overground antenna arrays [6, 7] by the Auger Engineering Radio\nArray (AERA) [8], the Low-Frequency Array (LOFAR) [9], the Taiwan Astroparticle Radiowave\nObservatory for Geo-synchrotron Emissions (TAROGE) [10], and the Tianshan Radio Experiment\nfor Neutrino Detection (TREND) [11]; using underground arrays [12] by the Askaryan Radio\nArray (ARA) [13] and the Antarctic Ross Ice Shelf Antenna Neutrino Array (ARIANNA) [14];\n– 1 –GRAND@Auger\n10 antennas\nMalargüe, Argentina\nLook for coincident\ndetection with Auger\nGRAND@Nançay\n4 antennas\nNançay, France\nFor testbenching\nGRANDProto300\n13     65 (now)      300 antennas⇢→\nDunhuang, China\nEstablish efficient autonomous\nradio-detection of air showers\nFigure 1.The GRAND prototype arrays.The three GRAND prototype arrays were deployed in 2023 and\nhave been in operation since.

Concurrent\nwith GRAND, the new Radio Detector of the AugerPrime upgrade [16], the upcoming Payload\nfor Ultrahigh Energy Observations (PUEO) [17], and the proposed next-generation Beamforming\nElevated Array for COsmic Neutrinos (BEACON) [18] and Radar Echo Telescope (RET-CR) [19]\nalso target the radio-detection of UHE particles, though adopting different, complementary [20]\ndetection strategies. References [21–23] present an overview of upcoming UHE detectors.\nBuilding on the experience gained by these experiments—most directly, by AERA and\nTREND—GRANDplanstodeployantennaarraysatalargerscale[1,24]. Thisinvolvesincreasing\nthe number of antennas deployed—to eventually tens of thousands—and deploying them in arrays\nthat are sparser than before—with km-scale antenna separations. This up-scaling is requisite for\nthe antenna arrays to monitor the large volumes of the atmosphere needed to deliver vast numbers\nofdetectedUHECRs[1]andasensitivitytoeventinyfluxesofUHEneutrinos[1,21–23,25]. The\nGRAND Collaboration plans to achieve this while keeping its carbon footprint low [26].\nSuch an enterprise involves facing technical challenges that, while significant, are surmount-\nable. To face them, GRAND is to be built with a staged construction plan [1, 27, 28] designed to\nvalidatethedesignandoperationoftheexperimentinsmallerscalesbeforedeployinglargerarrays.\nFigure 1 shows the locations of the GRAND prototypes, in operation since 2023 [28]:\nGRAND@Nançayin Nançay, France,GRANDProto300[29] in Dunhuang, China, andGRAND\n@Auger[30]inMalargüe,Argentina,atthesiteofthePierreAugerObservatory(PierreAuger)[31].\nTheir purpose is to validate two core requirements that GRAND must fulfill to achieve its goals.\nFirst, the prototypes must validate the viability of autonomous radio-detection of air showers\nin a sparse radio array [32–35], unaided by particle detectors, and despite the presence of natural\nand anthropogenic radio background that may mimic the radio signatures expected from showers.\n– 2 –Second, the prototypes must validate that the arrays are able to operate under harsh environmental\nfield conditions—high temperature, sandstorms, rainstorms—for prolonged periods of time. The\nlessons garnered from the prototypes will inform the design of the experiment in later stages.\nInthispaper,weintroducethedesignandoperationoftheGRANDprototypearrays,focusing\non the two larger ones, GRANDProto300 (GP300) and GRAND@Auger (G@A). In addition,\nwe present the first results obtained by them during their first two years of operation: the time-\ndependent and time-averaged radio spectra measured by them, including identified sources of\nradio background.The ongoing operation of the arrays—though not devoid of challenges—\ncoupled with their early-data results, validate the resilience of the GRAND design to adapt to\ndifferent environmental conditions, a requirement to pursue future, larger stages of GRAND.\nThis constitutes the basis for demonstrating the autonomous detection of cosmic rays in GRAND,\nwhich will be shown in future publications (see Ref. [35] for preliminary results).\nTheremainderofthepaperisorganizedasfollows. Section2introducestheGRANDprototype\narrays, their sites, and layouts. Section 3 describes the GRAND detection unit, its hardware,\nsoftware, and performance. Section 4 presents the self-trigger algorithm of the experiment and\nthe data acquisition software. Section 5 describes the data transfer pipeline, from local and central\nstorage on-site to permanent storage off-site. Section 6 presents the offline data-quality monitoring\ntoolsoftheexperiment. Section7showsthefirstradiospectraobservedbytheGRANDprototypes,\nincluding identified background sources. Section 8 summarizes and concludes.\n2 Overview of the GRAND prototype arrays\nThe site and array layout for each GRAND prototype were decided to fulfill their specific goals:\ntestbenching for GRAND@Nançay, demonstrating the autonomous radio-detection of air showers\nfor GP300, and observing coincident detection of air showers with the Pierre Auger detectors in\nG@A.Theradiobackgroundvariesbetweensites,withthebackgroundatGRAND@Nançaybeing\nthe loudest, and the background at GP300 being appreciably smaller than at G@A, predominantly\ndue to GP300 being farther from human activity.\nGRAND@Nançay.—GRAND@NançayisasmallarrayoffourGRANDdetectionunits(DUs,\nSection 3) located at the Nançay Radio Observatory, in France. It was conceived as a field site\naccessibletoEuropeanlaboratories,facilitatingtestbenchingofequipmentandnewideasindesign,\ntrigger, and data acquisition. The design of GRAND@Nançay resembles that of the other two\nprototype arrays, though with notable differences, such as having antennas of lower height and\ncommunications via optical fiber instead of wireless. Due to its small size, it serves primarily as a\ntestbed. In the remainder of the paper, we focus on GRANDProto300 and GRAND@Auger.\nGRANDProto300.—GP300 is the pathfinder array for GRAND in the Northern Hemisphere.\nIn its final stage, it will be a 300-antenna array; presently, it exists in partial configurations.\nThe 300-antenna stage of GP300 will span an area of about 200 km2 in the Gobi Desert near\nXiaodushan, in northern Dunhuang, China, making it the largest of the three prototypes. The site\nis a largely radio-quiet region in the 50–200 MHz radio-frequency band, which GRAND adopts as\nits working frequency band. The precise location was chosen after a survey of regions that contain\na relatively flat area capable of hosting the final 300-antenna stage of GP300, and that was located\n– 3 –□4000 □3000 □2000 □1000 0 1000 2000\nx [m]\n□2000\n□1000\n0\n1000\n2000\n3000\n4000\n5000\ny [m]\n10\n1\n8\n11\n6\n2\n9\n12\n3\n7\n4\n5\n13\n119\n116\n106\n93\n102\n91\n81\n78\n88\n47\n44\n85\n43\n37\n40\n82\n55\n31\n28\n52\n15\n20\n23\n35\n11\n8\n32\n48\n19\n51\n7\n16\n5\n27\n2\n24\n13\n39\n1\n12\n38\n4\n3\n25\n26\n50\n18\n49\n6\n17\n10\n9\n33\n34\n22\n14\n21\n54\n30\n29\n53\n42\n36\n41\n46\n45\nCS1\nCS2\nCS: Central Station\nGRANDProto300\ndetection units\nGP300 s65 (Apr 25–present)\nGP300 s13 (Jun 23–Apr 25)\n□26000 □25500 □25000 □24500\nx [m]\n14600\n14800\n15000\n15200\n15400\n15600\n15800\n16000\nCRS\n35 36\n135\n44\n5\n9\n25\n27\n82\n136 137\n146145\n152\n85 157\n58\n49\n69\n59\n83\n70\n144\n60\n84\n151\nAccess road\nCRS: Central Radio Station\nGRAND@Auger detection unit\nAERA station\nN\nFigure 2.Array layout of GRANDProto300 (left) and of GRAND@Auger (right).Each GRAND\ndetection unit (DU) has an assigned identification number.

For GRANDProto300, the DUs from the 13-antenna stage, GP300_s13, were repositioned as\npart of the 65-antenna stage, GP300_s65, in May of 2025, and the original Central Station 1 (CS1) was\nreplacedbythenewCS2.

By April of 2025, the array was extended to its current\n65-antenna stage, GP300_s65, which has been operating since and whose additional goals include\ntesting the efficiency and purity of the detection of inclined air showers from UHECRs. GP300,\neven in partial configuration, is expected to detect UHECRs with energies between 100PeV and a\nfew EeV, probing the Galactic to extragalactic transition region of cosmic ray origin.\nFigure2showsthelayoutofGP300_s13andGP300_s65.

A hexagonal array has fewer\ndirections along which the performance of shower-reconstruction methods is degraded as a result\nof the shower trajectory being aligned with the axes of symmetry of the array layout.\nGP300_s13 had a three-hexagon layout, covering an area of about 2 km2 with a DU spacing\nof about 500 m. The Central Station 1 (CS1) was built north-west of the array; it consisted of\nthree sets of container rooms that stored the central data acquisition (DAQ) computer and the\nlodgingandcookingfacilities.

The array has a dense region to the east with a DU\nspacing of 577 m and a sparse region to the west with a spacing of 1000 m. A new Central Station\n(CS2) was built for GP300_s65 and placed at its center.\nPreliminary simulations [37] estimate that the full GP300 array may detect about 130 inclined\ncosmic-rayeventsperday—foranideal100%uptimeofthedetector—intheenergyrangeof10 17–\n1020 eV, reaching a trigger efficiency of 90% already at1018.3 eV.

Although the search for these cosmic rays is\ncomplicated by firmware and DAQ changes made during prototype testing, it has already yielded\nits first likely candidates in GP300_s65 data [38–40].\nGRAND@Auger.—G@A results from an agreement between the GRAND and Pierre Auger\nCollaborations to repurpose 10 AERA radio-stations in Malargüe, Argentina, into GRAND DUs.\nThedeploymentofG@AwascompletedinAugustof2023andithasbeenoperatingsince.

Ten of the AERA Phase-2 stations were modified into GRAND\nDUs. The DUs are laid on two superimposed hexagons with a predominant spacing of 250 m,\ncovering an area of 0.5 km2. The G@A central DAQ computer is located in the AERA Central\nRadio Station (CRS). Nearby roads facilitate access to the site.\nFor G@A, using a denser detector layout enhances the detection of less energetic and less\ninclined events.

In the following sections, we discuss the\ncharacteristics of the antenna, LNAs, the GRAND FEB, power supply, and communications setup.\n3.2 Antenna and low-noise amplifier\nAntenna.—Figure 5, left, shows that the antenna itself consists of five arms: two dipoles in the\nNorth-South and East-West directions, and a monopole in the vertical direction. The dipole size is\nroughly 1.4 m, to match the GRAND working frequency band of 50–200 MHz. Figure 5, right,\nshows the acrylic nut with an internal connector to which the antenna arms are attached. The LNA\nboard is housed in the metal base of the nut and is powered by a coaxial cable that also transports\nreceived signals to the FEB.\nFigure6showsthesimulatedresponseoftheGRANDHorizonAntennatoanincomingradio\nsignal, expressed in the form of the magnitude of the vector effective length (VEL),Leff.

[48].\nFor theHorizonAntenna, the VEL was simulated using the Ansys HFSS (high-frequency\nstructure simulator) program, with a setup that included the complete mechanical structure of the\nDU. The resulting VEL is an elaborate function of frequency, zenith, and azimuth angle that fully\ncharacterizes the response of the antenna to an arbitrary incoming plane-wave signal; see Fig. 5\nin Ref. [48]. This is an essential ingredient to produce simulated measurements and interpret real\nones.

Given the complexity of the VEL of theHorizonAntenna, its validation in\nthe field remains to be completed; a calibration campaign is planned to verify our simulations.\nFigure7showsthegroupdelayoftheHorizonAntenna,i.e.,thederivativewithrespecttothe\nfrequencyofthephaseshiftofthetransferfunctionoftheDU(Section3.4). Avaryinggroupdelay\nthroughout the working frequency range can lead to signal dispersion and loss of amplitude due to\ninterference effects.

For theHorizonAntenna,\n– 9 –Figure 9.Low-noise amplifier (LNA) board deployed at GRANDProto300 (left) and GRAND@Auger\n(right).The main components of the boards are: (1) connectors to the antenna, (2) balun, (3) matching\nnetwork, (4) amplifier, and (5) power. Although the components are in similar locations, their specifications\nare not the same in both boards. See Section 3.2 for details.\nthe group delay is nearly flat in frequency for the three antenna arms, with differences well below\n20 ns that do not significantly distort the expected pulse shape. Given the frequency bandwidth of\n200 MHz, group delay variations smaller than its inverse (5 ns) are acceptable. While there are\nsharp peaksin thegroup delay, they arenarrow enough tohave onlya small effecton signalpower.\nThe antenna responseis embedded in theGRANDlibprocessing pipeline [48] (Section 3.4) andis\nused in the reconstruction of the properties of showers detected by GRAND.\nFigure8showsthegainoftheHorizonAntenna,i.e.,theratiobetweenthepowertransmitted\ntotheantennafeedpointbyasignalcomingfromonespecificdirection(𝜃, 𝜙)andthesamequantity\naveraged over all directions.

At a zenith angle of85◦—closer to the ground—the\ngain remains close to unity for a large part of the 50–200MHz bandwidth, despite stronger ground\nattenuation. The slight difference between the X and Y arms is due to the influence of the solar\npanel placed at the foot of the antenna. Here again, like in Figs. 6 and 7, the Z arm exhibits a\ndifferent behavior, with a gain increasing with zenith angle, as expected, but also with frequency, a\nfeature we understand as a consequence of ground reflections.\nLNA.—Figure 9 shows the two designs of the LNA boards deployed in GP300 and G@A.\nFor GP300, the LNA board was designed to provide a stable gain of about 20 dB in the range of\n50–200 MHz. As shown in Fig. 9, left, in the GP300 board the X and Y paths are connected to the\n– 10 –dipoles and the Z path, to the monopole. When powered with 5 V from the FEB (more on it later),\nthe LNA board draws 47 mA for each channel, leading to a power consumption of about 235 mW\nforthefullboard. AnelectrostaticdischargeprotectionstructureguardstheLNAfromdamagedue\nto static electricity. The balun converts differential signals into single-ended signals and performs\nimpedance transformation. The matching network, located at the front-end of the LNA, converts\nthe impedance to 50Ω, minimizing impedance matching issues at the LNA input port.\nForG@A,theLNAdesignwasfocusedonprovidinghighergainatalowpowerconsumption.\nOur design provides a stable gain of about 30 dB for each of the X, Y, Z channels, in the same\nrange as GP300, 50–200 MHz. The noisier radio environment of G@A compared to GP300 leads\ntoadditionalnoisepickup. Wereitnotforthehigh-gainLNA,thisnoisewouldbeamplifiedbythe\nvariable gain amplifier on the FEB. Like in GP300, the board is powered with 5 V by the GRAND\nFEB; each channel draws 40 mA and the total power consumption of the board is 200 mW. As\nshown in Fig. 9, right, the path lengths for the X, Y, and Z channels in the LNA board are exactly\nthe same, leading to equal signal time delays for all channels. This allows for the study of the\ntime dependence of the polarization in an unbiased way, avoiding additional software corrections\nto the timing of the individual polarization directions. Given the weather conditions in Argentina,\nwe implemented moisture countermeasures to prevent water damage: the nuts are sealed with an\nadditional layer of silicone, and the LNA boards are coated with transparent lacquer.\nThe main differences in the output signals provided by the two designs of the LNA board are\nthe gain and the matching network. For GP300, the LNA has uniform matching across the full\nfrequency range. For G@A model, its matching is optimized for higher frequencies,i.e., above 80\nMHz. The difference in maximum gain for the LNA boards is compensated by the amplifier in the\nGRAND FEB, as described in the next section.\n3.3 Front-end board and firmware\nFigure 10 shows the prototype GRAND FEB used in GP300 and G@A. We describe its primary\ncomponents we below.\nAnalog chain.—The analog chain, component (1) in Fig. 10, serves multiple purposes. First,\nthe analog signals, coming from the LNA, are shaped through a fifth-order elliptical 30–200MHz-\nbandpassfilter. Inthefollowing,theypassthroughthevariablegainamplifier(VGA),whosesetting\niscontrolledbythedigitalpartoftheboard. Thegaincanvarybetween-10and+20dB.InGP300,\nwe use a VGA gain of 20dB; in G@A, we use a 0dB gain. In addition, the analog chain supplies\npower to the front-end LNA boards (Section 3.2) through a bias-T.\nFigure11showsthemeasuredanalogresponseoftheFEBboard. Forthisfigure,theVGAgain\nof the FEB was set at 3 dB before the measurement. The response was then measured to be nearly\nconstant in the GRAND working frequency range of 50–200 MHz, with a value of approximately\n3 dB, indicating that the signal is amplified properly.\nADC chip.—The FEBs digitize the signals after they pass the analog chain. The digitization\nuses a 14-bit 500MSPS, 4-channel analog-to-digital converter (ADC; Analog Devices, AD9694),\ncomponent (2) in Fig. 10, in differential mode with an input voltage range of±0.9V. This setting\nallows us to measure the background noise at around 30 ADC counts, leaving a dynamic range\nof about 9 effective bits. This yields a compromise between accurate noise determination and\n– 11 –Figure 10.The GRAND front-end board (FEB).The main components: (1) signal input and filter chain,\nwith four inputs available; (2) analog-to-digital (ADC) chip; (3) system on chip: field-programmable gate\narray (FPGA) and central processing unit (CPU) ; (4) Global Positioning System (GPS) chip and connector;\n(5)Ethernetchip;(6)clock;(7)powersupplyforthedigitalpartoftheboard;(8)powersupplyfortheanalog\npart of the board; and (9) power connector and switch.

Triggering is elaborated on in in Section 4.\nGPSandslowcontrolparameters.—Aftertriggering,thefirmwarebuildstheevent. Datafrom\nthe three input channels are combined with timing information from the GPS chip (Trimble RES\nSMT360), component (4) in Fig.10, and data from slow control parameters, such as air pressure\nand battery voltage. These are written in an event header, in which all configuration parameters\nare also stored. The local software inside the CPU is notified that an event is present and starts the\ntransfer into the local board memory.\nTriggeringanddatatransfer.—Twofirmwareversionsweretested,oneatGP300andtheother\natG@A.Theydifferinthemethodofdatatransferintomemory.

Given the quieter radio environment\nof GP300, the AXI speed is enough to deal with the trigger rate.\nHowever, the higher trigger rate at the G@A site required a faster memory transfer method.\nTherefore, at G@A, the software uses direct memory access (DMA transfer), moving all parts of\neach triggered event into double data rate (DDR) memory, which has a total size of 512MB. The\nfirmware may then apply a secondary “high-level” trigger algorithm to further reject uninteresting\nevents.

The RF chain receives as input an open-circuit voltage,𝑉oc, which\nemulates the output voltage from the antenna arms. The final output voltage ofGRANDlib,𝑉out,\nis the resulting signal after passing through the matching network, LNA, cables, connectors, and\nFEB. Reference [48] contains more details ofGRANDlib, the RF chain, and its implementation.\nThe implementation of the RF chain inGRANDlibis modular and can be adapted to the\ndifferent setups of GP300 and G@A. The RF chain is described viascattering parameters(S-\nparameters), which quantify the reflection and transmission of the signals as they travel through\nthe different components of a GRAND DU. The S-parameters of GP300 and G@A were measured\nseparately in the laboratory and fed toGRANDlib.\nFigure12showstheresultingsimulatedoverallsystemresponseasafunctionoffrequencyfor\nGP300andG@A.Theresponseisquantifiedviathetransferfunction,definedastheratio𝑉 out/𝑉oc,\n– 14 –measuredwithrespecttothebaseoftheDU(seealsoFig.8inRef.[48]). WithinGP300andG@A,\nthe transfer functions of the X and Y arms are similar to each other and different from the transfer\nfunction of the Z arm, reflecting their VELs (Fig. 6). However, the transfer functions are different\nin GP300 and G@A, primarily because of their different LNAs. Although refinement of the RF\nchain is still ongoing, the results in Fig. 12 already allow us to validate the setups by comparing\nsimulations to measurements of, for example, the Galactic radio background [29].\n3.5 Communications and power supply\nCommunication between the local and central DAQ software is done through TCP/IP sockets for\nboth G@A and GP300. Upon request from the central DAQ, the complete event is sent over the\nwireless network. This network is created through M5 (G@A) or AirMax (GP300)™Ubiquiti\nBullets, Rockets, and a parabolic communications antenna. For G@A these were provided by the\nPierre Auger Collaboration. Bi-directional transmission tests were performed point-to-point,i.e.,\nDU to DAQ, in both arrays, using a fixed file size. The uplink speed, from DU to DAQ, was on\naverage 2.9 MB s−1 for GP300 and 2.1 MB s−1 for G@A. The downlink speed, from DAQ to\nDU, was on average 4.2 MB s−1 for GP300 and 1.1 MB s−1 for G@A. The local and central DAQ\nsoftware pipeline is described in the next section.\nIn both arrays, the power supply of each DU consists of a solar panel, a charge controller, and\na battery. The power consumption of a single DU is roughly 15W. The power supply components\nwerespecifiedtoensuretheDUscanoperateforoneweekonafullbattery,evenwithoutinputfrom\nthesolarpanel. InGP300,thesolarpanelshaveanominalpowerof180W,withamaximumpower\nvoltageof19.5V.Low-noisechargecontrollers(GenasunGV-10-Pb-12V)werechosentoefficiently\ncharge the battery from the solar panel as well as provide power to the FEBs. Cold-resistant gel\nbatteries were selected, operating at a nominal output voltage of 12V with a capacity of 200Ah.\nIn G@A, the AERA electronics compartment and power harvesting were mostly re-used, as\nthe power requirements of the prototype GRAND FEB match the AERA electronics quite closely.\nThesolarpanelwasthesameoriginallydeployedintheAERA-IIstations(Kyocera135W),witha\nnominalpowerof135Wandmaximumoutputvoltageof16V.Newchargecontrollers,ofthesame\nmodelasdeployedatGP300,wereinstalledtoreplacetheoriginalAERAones. Thebatterieswere\nalso exchanged for lead-acid batteries with a nominal output voltage of 12V and 180Ah capacity.\nOverall, the final power supply for G@A has a smaller capacity than for GP300. As a result, G@A\nDUs may need to hibernate during Argentinian winters, depending on their battery levels.\nIn GP300 and G@A, the charge controllers are housed in Faraday cages. To further isolate\nthem from electromagnetic noise, a filter (Spectrum Control 1250-054) was added to the output\nof the charge controller. The Bullet is also housed in the FEB box at G@A, and, due to the\nheat-dissipation modifications, in a separate Faraday cage at GP300.\n4 Self-trigger and data acquisition\n4.1 Self-trigger algorithm\nThe main science case of GRAND—the study of ultra-high-energy particles [1]—involves the\ndetection of extensive air showers. The radio emission from air showers induces a temporary\n– 15 –Figure13.LocalTriggerflowforanincomingsignalataGRANDdetectionunit.Thetriggeralgorithm\nstarts when the amplitude of the signal exceeds the preset “signal threshold\",i.e., when a signal crossing\nhappens, as long as there was no such crossing in the preceding quiet time window. In the time period\nfollowing the signal crossing, called the “trigger period window”, the algorithm counts the number of\ncrossings of a lower “noise threshold\". If the number of noise-threshold crossings is between predefined\nallowed minimum and maximum values, and the time interval between any two adjacent noise-threshold\ncrossings does not exceed a predefined maximum value, the trigger process is completed and the signal is\naccepted. Because the trigger logic runs under the 500-MHz clock in the FPGA, the timing has a resolution\nof 2 ns. The time stamp, corresponding to the time of the end of the trigger period window, is recorded and\nit is sent to the Central DAQ.\ndistortion of the local electric field, with a duration of several nanoseconds. Through the data\nacquisition chain described above, this distortion is translated into a short transient in the voltage\ninputtotheADC.However,anthropogenicsourcesalsoemitradiopulseswithsimilarcharacteristics.\nThus, air-shower experiments that rely solely on their radio-detection, like the GRAND prototype\narrays, must have a self-triggering procedure that selects only detected events that resemble those\nexpected from air showers.\nThe detected radio pulse emitted by an air shower generates a short-duration, high-amplitude\n(relative to the average baseline) oscillation in the FEB output. Man-made noise usually creates\na wider pulse or a train of pulses. In addition, constructive interference of single-frequency\nanthropogenic sources can also create air shower-like pulses. The Local Trigger happens at the\nDU level and is implemented within the firmware running on the FPGA chip. Its aim is to select\nair-shower candidates while rejecting background pulses by efficiently identifying peaks in the\ndifferenceoftwoconsecutiveADCsamples. WiththeprototypeGRANDFEB,itispossibletofirst\nremove single-frequency noise sources with a digital filter, as shown in Section 3.3. The resulting\nfiltered signal is fed to the trigger algorithm.\nFigure 13 shows a representative flowchart of the trigger algorithm, which begins with a\nconfigurable “signal threshold”. If the signal exceeds this threshold and there has not been any\nthreshold crossing in a time window prior to the current pulse, the algorithm starts. The signal\n– 16 –threshold is set to a value that is suitably higher than the average noise level, while maintaining a\nreasonable trigger rate. The second of these conditions aims to avoid pulse trains. Next, in a time\nwindow after the pulse, the system counts how many times a second “noise threshold” is crossed.\nThe width of the time windows, the signal and noise threshold levels, the allowed maximum\nnumber of crossings of the noise threshold, and the maximum time between successive crossings\nare adjustable parameters. They are set offline at the Central DAQ prior to each data acquisition\nrun. The values are chosen to best reject long and/or irregular pulse trains, and to prevent digital\nglitchesfromcorruptingthevoltagetraces. Thistriggerflexibilityallowsustoadapttothedifferent\nnoise environments of each array, with G@A requiring stricter settings to avoid the more frequent\nnarrow and broadband radio frequency interference (RFI). When all triggering conditions are met,\nthe Local Trigger is complete and the timestamp is sent to the Central DAQ.\nNext to recording air showers, the arrays also keep track of the background conditions via\nunbiasedtriggering. This corresponds to periodically recorded data, independent of the measured\nvoltage levels. Such unbiased data are suitable for monitoring the environment and for calibrating\nthe setups using the periodic variation of the Galactic noise, which is currently ongoing [30, 36].\nUnbiased data can also be used for additional science cases like measuring fast radio bursts [48].\nUnbiased triggering, by default, takes place once every 10 s (a pre-defined 20-Hz mode is also\navailable). In the G@A firmware version, it is possible to set the unbiased triggering frequency\nbetween 1Hz and 100kHz. GP300 and G@A perform both transient and unbiased triggering.\nAchievingahighself-triggerperformanceiskeytothesuccessofastandaloneradio-detection\nexperimentsuchasGRAND.Theachievedtriggerrateasafunctionoftheincomingrateoftransient\npulses is of particular importance.

The Central Trigger conditions are checked at the\nCentral DAQ and, if met, the complete event information is requested of each Local DAQ. The full event\nis sent and erased from local memory and the Central DAQ writes the final data to disk. The cycle repeats\nindefinitely while the data-taking is ongoing. Unbiased triggered events bypass the Local Trigger at the\nFPGA but still go through the same DAQ pipeline. See Section 4 for details.\nanditsevent-buildingprocess. Thisprocesscombinesallinformationintoasingleeventandwrites\nthe data to the local disk. All coincident transient triggered data that satisfy the Central Trigger are\nrecorded incoincident data(CD) binary files.\nFurthermore, a random selection of local transient triggered events can be promoted to a\nCentral Trigger and be saved as well. These events have no coincidences with other DUs and are\nusedtomonitorthetriggeralgorithmandthenoiseenvironment. Theyarestoredseparatelyinunit\ndata(UD) binary files. Unbiased triggers are always promoted to Central triggers and are saved in\nmonitoringdata (MD) files.\n5 Data storage\nThe final data files of each trigger type—CD, UD, and MD—are saved on the local storage of the\nCentral DAQ computer in GP300 and G@A. For GP300, the binary files are sent in real time to a\ncomputercenterinNanjing,China,throughawirelessbridge. Thefilesarethenmanuallymovedto\nthe CC-IN2P3 cluster in Lyon, France. For G@A, new files on disk are copied daily to the central\nstorage in CC-IN2P3 using the 4G network. This copying does not interfere with the data-taking\nor the bandwidth used by the Pierre Auger Collaboration. In case of high RFI conditions or failed\noff-site data transfer, the DAQ computer has enough memory to store all data.\nThe automatic copying requires a local bash script to run automatically (i.e., acronjob) on\nthe central computer for G@A and semi-manually for GP300. This script first searches for files\nnot already transferred to CC-IN2P3 and stores this list in a simple local SQLite database. This\n– 18 –database is used to keep track of previously transferred files and to determine if a file needs to be\nsent. Afterwards,thenewdatafilesarerelayedtothecorrespondingdirectoriesonCC-IN2P3using\nrsyncand then flagged into the local SQLite database.\nWhen data dispatch is finalized, a second script is triggered in CC-IN2P3 that registers all\nnewly transferred files in the main database and launches the conversion into the GRANDRoot\nformat, described in Ref. [48]. The GRANDRoot files are moved to the corresponding directories\nand registered in the main database.\n6 Data quality monitoring\nTo ensure adequate data quality during the deployment and commissioning phases of GP300 and\nG@A,afewkeyparametersaretrackedineveryDU.Aspreviouslystated,acompleteeventconsists\nofthetriggeredADCtimetracesandtheslowcontrolparameters,likethebatterylevelattheboard\ninput, the GPS, and, in G@A alone, the ADC and FPGA chip temperatures and the trigger rate.\nThrough the unbiased triggered data, these parameters can be continuously monitored. Their\nbehaviorwasusednotonlytocommissionthearraysbutalsotovalidatethefirmwareandthelocal\nand central DAQ software. Other features—such as their root mean square (RMS), fast Fourier\ntransform, and power spectral densities (PSDs)—are extracted from the ADC traces in the time\ndomain to monitor day-night effects and detect local radio transients. Particularly, the PSDs can\nbe used to characterize the environment radio background, the electronic noise self-induced by the\nsetup, the Galactic radio background, and the RFI. These parameters are checked daily to ensure\noptimal operation of the setups. We monitor their behavior over time, comparing them between\nDUs to achieve consistent data quality across the array.\nThe commissioning is facilitated by a data monitoring web page. The page is updated daily at\n05:00CET,byacrontabjobthatrunsaseriesofscriptsatCC-IN2P3onthedatafrombotharrays.\nThe DU uptime, the mean RMS of the last 24 hours of traces, battery levels, and temperatures\nare tracked as a function of time. Averaged PSDs are also displayed for easy comparison between\nchannels and between DUs. The page also stores the averages over the last 7 days and the last 30\ndays. There is flexibility to present the data of all DUs together or of only the desired ones.\n7 First results\nGP300andG@Ahaveoperatedforabouttwoyearssincetheendoftheirdeployment(withGP300\nchanging from comprising 13 to 65 DUs). Throughout this period, enough unbiased triggered data\nwascollectedtocharacterizetheperformanceoftheDUsandthelocalelectromagneticenvironment.\nThese studies were performed in the frequency domain, where the complete antenna readout chain\nisbetterunderstoodandbackgroundsourcescanbeidentified. Inaddition,astheDUsaredeployed\nrelatively close together, working in the frequency domain allowed us to verify that all of them\nshowed similar response, which is needed to understand the relative calibration between DUs.\nFigure 15 shows spectrograms generated using data collected by two DUs, one from GP300\nandonefromG@A,overaperiodofaboutnineandthirteendays,respectively. Thesespectrograms\nare representative of the standard behavior of all DUs in their respective arrays.\n– 19 –Power spectrum density [mV² MHz⁻¹]\n10⁻⁴ 10⁻³ 10⁻² 10⁻¹ 10⁰ 10¹ 10² 10³\nGRAND@AugerGRANDProto300\nNorth-South\nEast-West\nVertical\nNorth-South\nEast-West\nVertical\nFigure 15.Spectrograms measured by GRAND detection units.Each row shows spectrograms for a dif-\nferent antenna polarization: North-South (top), East-West (center), and vertical (bottom).

Of the intermittent contributions,\none at around 70 MHz can be seen in all polarizations, where there is an increase of amplitude for\na few hours with no clear periodicity. In the North-South polarization, the four lines within 60–80\nMHz correspond to the known emission of the AERA beacon, set up at the CRS (see Fig. 2).\nIn Fig. 15, the white horizontal lines represent periods of DU hibernation, after which data\nacquisition resumes autonomously once the conditions are appropriate. The G@A DU had more\nhibernation periods than the GP300 DU, a reflection of the harsher environment in Argentina,\nleading to more periods with insufficient sunlight to power the batteries and more instances of\noverheating. In general, the radio environment at GP300 is considerably quieter than at G@A,\nbut wide background-free frequency bands exist at both sites. Nevertheless, the background in\nseveral frequency ranges is substantial and can negatively influence the self-trigger capabilities of\nthe system, especially in G@A.\nFigure 16 shows the time-averaged PSDs of GP300 and G@A, where the background noise\n– 21 –contributions can be more clearly seen. For GP300, the PSD is mostly free of peaks, except in the\n118–140MHzrange—inagreementwithFig.15—wheretherearestrongcontributionsfromplane\nandsatellitecommunications.

In particular, the G@A PSD characterizes the electromagnetic background at the Pierre\nAuger site at frequencies much higher than either AERA or the Auger Radio Detector are capable\nof measuring. This can aid and complement analyses of the Pierre Auger Collaboration—another\nexample of the synergy between the Pierre Auger Observatory and GRAND.\nFigures 15 and 16 show that, while radio background is unavoidable in both arrays, it is\nlocalized within frequency ranges that can be isolated and masked out in specific analyses. For\ninstance,searchesforthediffuseGalacticradioemissionrequirenoise-freefrequencyranges,dueto\ntheloweremissionamplitudeofthisbackgroundcomparedtoartificialradiosources. Thissearchis\nongoing in both prototype arrays [29, 30], since it presents an opportunity for detector calibration.\nThe above results show that the radio background at both sites is understood. At the GP300\nsite, there are fewer RFI sources compared to the G@A site. The baseline levels of the PSDs are\nthe same for both prototype arrays, around10−2 mV2 MHz−1. In summary, early data from the\nGRAND prototype arrays already validate their usefulness: that,despite differences in hardware\nand software, the overall response of the GRAND DU is consistent regardless of the deployment\nsite.This is a structural finding for future cross-calibration runs and for the later stages of the\nexperiment, which envision two or more 10,000-DU arrays deployed at different geographical\nlocations, and whose data will be analyzed jointly.\n8 Summary and perspectives\nThe Giant Radio Array for Neutrino Detection (GRAND) is a planned observatory of ultra-high-\nenergy particles of cosmic origin: cosmic rays, neutrinos, and gamma rays. GRAND aims to\ndetect the radio emission from air showers initiated by their interaction in the atmosphere using\nlarge ground arrays of antennas. The next large deployment goal of GRAND is to have two arrays\nconsistingof10,000antennaseachintheNorthernandSouthernHemispheres. Toachievethis,the\nGRANDCollaborationhasadoptedastagedapproachtodeployment,withthreeongoingprototype\narrays to test and validate the detection and reconstruction methods.\nThree prototype arrays were deployed in 2023. GRAND@Nançay, in France, is a 4-antenna\narrayusedasatestbenchfortheCollaboration’sEuropeanlaboratories. GRANDProto300,inChina,\nhasgonethroughtwostagesofdeployment,fromaninitial13-antennastagetoitscurrent65-antenna\nstage. These stages act as pathfinders for the future final 300-antenna array. GRAND@Auger, in\nArgentina, stems from an agreement between the GRAND and the Pierre Auger Collaborations.\nThe 10-antenna array was deployed on modified AERA stations. In this paper, we focused on the\nhardware, software, and early operation of GRANDProto300 and GRAND@Auger.\nTo adapt to local conditions and explore optimal designs for the final GRAND setup, the\nprototype array at each site featured different key choices in hardware and software. Throughout\n2023, the arrays, including their hardware, firmware, and DAQ software, were commissioned\nusing daily data monitoring. Operating these prototypes under prolonged field conditions exposed\nhardware and software challenges that have been met.\n– 23 –GRANDProto300andGRAND@Augerhaveremainedlargelyoperationalforabouttwoyears.\nTheir data have been analyzed and understood. We have shown results based on these data that\ndemonstrate the adequacy of the GRAND experimental setup and provide an understanding of the\nradiobackgroundpresentateachsite. ThedetectionoftheGalacticradioemission—thesearchfor\nwhich is ongoing in both prototypes—will refine the calibration of the GRAND detection units.\nTheGRANDprototypeshavealreadyyieldedakeyresult: thattheperformanceoftheGRAND\ndetection units is similar at the two array sites, despite one having a radio background notably\nhigher than the other, and despite their differences in hardware and software. The demonstrated\nresilience of the GRAND DU is not merely a technical achievement; it is a foundational scientific\nresult for the entire project. A future stage of GRAND consisting of arrays distributed in multiple\ngeographicallocationswillinevitablyfacediverseenvironmentalandradio-backgroundconditions.\nOur finding that consistent performance can be achieved through adaptable hardware and software\nconfirms the feasibility of combining data from geographically distant arrays. This is essential for\nachieving the full-sky coverage and large-scale exposure of future stages of GRAND.\nThe ultimate goal of GRANDProto300 and GRAND@Auger is to validate the autonomous\nradio-detection of inclined extensive air showers in GRAND, expected from ultra-high-energy\ncosmic rays, neutrinos, and gamma rays. This detection, triggered by no signal other than radio,\nand with a high efficiency, is essential to the goals of GRAND. Presently, the data collected by\nGRANDProto300 and GRAND@Auger are being searched for air showers initiated by ultra-high-\nenergy cosmic rays. In GRANDProto300, we have identified the first cosmic-ray candidates [38–\n43]. In GRAND@Auger, the detection of cosmic-ray candidates is being validated through their\ncoincident detection by the Pierre Auger Observatory [47].\nAcknowledgments\nThe GRAND Collaboration acknowledges the significant contributions to this manuscript of Beat-\nriz de Errico, for her work on data management and analysis, site survey and construction, DAQ\nsoftwaredebugging,manuscriptwriting,andfigurepreparation;andofShenWang,forhisworkon\nGP300sitesurveyandconstruction,hardwareverification,andmanuscriptplanningandwriting.

The decay exponentβclearly deviates from values known for classical systems.\nIntroduction.—Fluid turbulence has been among the first\nsystems used to study spatial and temporal scaling phenom-\nena in nature [1–7]. In three spatial dimensions, driven, fully\ndeveloped turbulence has been characterized as a direct cas-\ncade, in which kinetic energy is transferred from large to small\nspatial scales through an inertial range, establishing the sta-\ntionary spectral distributionE(k)∼k −5/3. In contrast, re-\nstricting the dynamics to a (quasi-)2d geometry, the energy\nis transported in the opposite direction as large-scale eddies\nare formed from smaller ones, which forms an inverse cas-\ncade, giving rise to the same stationary algebraic momentum\ndistribution,E(k)∼k −5/3 [8–10]. On scales where quantum\nstatistics and coherence prevail, superfluid or quantum turbu-\nlence emerges in inviscid superfluids, including 4He and di-\nlute Bose-Einstein condensates [11–14]. The elementary con-\nstituents of the flow are quantum vortices, carrying point-like\nvorticity with discrete valuesqh/m,q∈Z. They thus differ\nfrom classical eddies in their microscopic properties, while\non large scales certain characteristics of classical fluid turbu-\nlence, like the inverse energy cascade (IEC) in two dimen-\nsions, have been recovered in superfluids [15–17].\nWhile the standard setting discussed is fully developed tur-\nbulence, where the driving introduces as much energy per\nunit time as is lost at the dissipative end of the inertial range,\ne.g., to thermal excitations, other scenarios of interest are the\nbuildup and decay of a turbulent cascade. Of particular rele-\nvance in this regard is the evolution within a closed system,\ni.e., without energy and particle gain and loss. As for classi-\ncal 3d [18, 19] as well as 2d turbulence [20–32] the decay of\nturbulence has been discussed for and measured in quantum\nsystems, cf., e.g., [33, 34]. In 2d, studies of decaying quan-\ntum turbulence have focused on Onsager-Kraichnan conden-\nsation of vortex clusters and the loss of vortex-antivortex pairs\n[35–37], the direct enstrophy cascade [38], and finite temper-\natures [39]. The latter work examined the scaling evolution\nof single-particle spectra, vortex number, and inter-defect dis-\ntance, characterizing the vortex decay and scaling evolution\n∗niklas.rasch@kip.uni-heidelberg.de\n†t.gasenzer@uni-heidelberg.de\nas universal dynamics near a non-thermal fixed point (NTFP)\n[40–44], see [39, 45–62] in the context of vortex dynamics.\nIn analogy to the theory of equilibrium critical phenomena,\nuniversal scaling dynamics has been proposed to be associ-\nated with NTFPs, see [63–66] for overviews. These fixed\npoints are thought to result from considering time evolution\nas a renormalization-group flow, classifying space-time scal-\ning based on symmetries and the character of the field config-\nurations. Recent experiments have explored various phenom-\nena and properties of universal space-time scaling, largely in\nultracold gases [15, 67–77].\nMain result.—We show that the appearance of the anoma-\nlous NTFP in a dilute 2d superfluid [51, 62] is directly re-\nlated to the decay of quantum turbulence, exhibiting long-\nrange spatial scaling of the second moment of velocity circu-\nlationΓaccording to the Kolmogorov-Kraichnan power-law\nΓ2(r)∼r 8/3. Moreover, we find the scaling of higher mo-\nments of the velocity circulation to show intermittent devia-\ntions consistent with the bifractal intermittency model studied\nin stationary IECs [78, 79]. In contrast, vortex separation is\nfound to remain Gaussian distributed throughout the universal\ndynamics and does not exhibit intermittent behavior in time.\nIn turn, the decaying 2d quantum turbulence in the closed sys-\ntem is characterized by a growth of the inter-defect distance,\nℓv ∼t β, with an anomalously small, subdiffusive exponent\nβ≈1/5, distinctly smaller than what is known from classical\nturbulence [80]. The vortex pattern coarsening is associated\nwith an inverse cascade of the kinetic energy of incompress-\nible fluid flow, exhibiting classical scaling, which decays and\nthereby expands further to lower momenta according to the\nconservation law associated with the NTFP. Our results link\nsuperfluid turbulence in a closed 2d system, on the grounds of\na high-resolution analysis in the spatial domain, to the concept\nof NTFPs in far-from-equilibrium dynamics.\nNon-thermal fixed points vs. turbulence.—For single-com-\nponent, scalar quantum field theories universal dynamics near\nNTFPs is usually dominated by nonlinear excitations of the to-\ntal density such as vortices, solitons, or kinks [15, 39, 45–62].\nThe spatio-temporal coarsening of the field pattern is reflected\nin the loss of these excitations, and the length scaleℓ(t)∼t β\nis typically associated with the mean inter-defect distance. In\nquasi-2d Bose gases, two distinct scaling exponents,β≈1/5\narXiv:2509.21285v1  [cond-mat.quant-gas]  25 Sep 20252\n-16 16\nx [103 aho]\n-16\n16y [103 aho]\n(a) t = 0\n-16 16\nx [103 aho]\n(b) t = 103\n-16 16\nx [103 aho]\n(c) t = 104\n-16 16\n-16 16\nx [103 aho]\n(d) t = 105\n-16 16\nx [103 aho]\n-16\n16\ny [103 aho]\n0.4 1.9|j|/⟨|j|⟩\n 0 2ρ2/⟨ρ2⟩\nFIG. 1.

The system approaches\nspace-time scaling near the anomalous NTFP within the time intervalt≈(0.3...2)·10 4(2π)/ωz, corresponding to a decaying turbulent cascade,\ntogether with spatial scaling characteristics akin to 2d fully developed turbulence. The insets show the corresponding snapshots of the density\nnormalized to its spatial average,ρ2/⟨ρ2⟩.\nandβ≈1/2, corresponding to an anomalous and a Gaussian\nNTFP, respectively, are found [15, 39, 48, 50–52, 55, 56, 60–\n62]. These reflect different vortex annihilation processes:\nβ=1/2 arises from friction due to interaction with sound\nexcitations, causing direct vortex-antivortex annihilations ac-\ncording to a two-body scattering rate. In contrast,β=1/5 re-\nsults for annihilations relying on three-vortex processes bring-\ning the vortex pairs of opposite circulation sufficiently close to\neach other. At early times and low temperatures, before vor-\ntex annihilations generate thermalizing sound noise, the sub-\ndiffusive exponent dominates [15, 51, 52, 56, 60–62].\nIn turbulence, an important observable besides energy spec-\ntra is the statistics of velocity increments,δv r(x)=v(x+r)−\nv(x), which are Gaussian for larger=|r|[1] but develop\nheavy tails at smaller scales. These deviations, termed inter-\nmittency [81], are quantified by higher-order structure func-\ntionsS p(r)=⟨|δv r(x)|p⟩, which scale asS p(r)∼r ζp with\nζ1 =1/3 in a fully developed 2d IEC. The higher exponents\nhave been found both numerically [82] and experimentally\n[83] to scale asζ p =p/3, implying the absence of intermit-\ntency, unlike 3d turbulence [84]. Instead of velocity incre-\nments, however, the moments of the velocity circulation,\nΓ(r,x)=\nI\nCr,x\nvdl,(1)\nevaluated along a pathCr,x, e.g., a circle of radiusraround the\npointx[85], exhibit intermittency in the IEC, as seen in ex-\nperiments [78] and simulations [79]. Velocity circulations are\nof particular interest in quantum turbulence since, by Stokes’\ntheorem, they equal area integrals of quantized vorticity, i.e.,\nthe net circulation of vortices within a given area.\n2d Bose gas.—We consider a single-component 2d dilute\nsuperfluid in the vicinity of the anomalous NTFP, exhibiting\nsubdiffusive scaling (β≈1/5≪1/2) [51, 62]. Its dynamics\nis defined by the 2d Gross-Pitaevskii equation (GPE),\ni∂tψ(r,t)=\n\u0010\n−∇2/2+g 2 ρ2(r,t)\n\u0011\nψ(r,t),(2)\nwhereρ 2(r,t)=|ψ(r,t)| 2 is the local 2d density andg 2 the\ndimensionless coupling, cf. App. A for details of parameters\nand units. We initialize the 2d Bose gas in a square vol-\nume with periodic boundary conditions, using an ensemble\nofN v =1.4·10 6 randomly distributed (anti)vortices with zero\nnet winding. Fig. 1a shows an example of the corresponding\nnormalized current,j=ρ 2v=ρ 2∇θand density field from\nψ= √ρ2eiθ. The field is propagated via Eq. (2) using the\nsemi-classical Truncated-Wigner approximation (TW A) [86],\ncf. App. A 3 for details of initialization and propagation.\nVortex pattern coarsening close to the anomalous NTFP.—\nFig. 1 shows four snapshots of the system for an exemplary\nrun, see [87] for a video. The current exhibits vortex clusters\nsurrounded by strong coherent flows, which weaken in time\nalong with the coarsening of the vortex pattern, also reflected\nin the growing density variation patterns. Choosing a high\ninitial vortex number, transport to lower wave numbers and\nthus the mutual annihilation of vortices and antivortices sets in\nquickly, while achieving a sufficient large-rresolution of the\ncirculation correlators. By the timet≈10 3(2π)/ωz, shown\nin Fig. 1b, the dynamics has lead from the non-equilibrium\ninitial condition to the build-up of a turbulent cascade, which\nexhibits decay due to the lack of external driving.\nWe find the coarsening to be characterized by an algebraic\ntime evolution of the mean inter-defect, i.e., the shortest dis-\ntance between a vortex and its neighbor,ℓv(t)∼t β, and of the\nmean vortex number,N v(t)∼t −2β, cf. Fig. 2b. After an initial\nbuildup phase, the scaling exponent takes the subdiffusion-\ntype valueβ≈1/5, consistent with the anomalous NTFP de-\nscribed in [51, 62] and remains approximately constant within\nthe time interval 3·10 3 ≲(2π) −1ωzt≲2·10 4. At later times,\ncf. Fig. 1d, the vortex number decay departs from anoma-\nlous scaling due to an increased presence of sound excitations\nfostering two-body vortex annihilations, withβeffectively\nincreasing (cf. Fig. 2b) until the system eventually reaches\ndiffusion-type scaling withβ≈1/2 [51, 62].

(c) Comparison of the\nfitted time-dependentβexponent extracted from the vortex number in (b) and the maximal local slopeλ 2,max from (a). The system approaches\nuniversal dynamics, indicated byβ≈1/5, at the highlighted intermediate times, which is accompanied by the buildup of a transient 2d\nturbulent Kolmogorov-Kraichnan scaling corresponding to a decaying IEC.\ndecaying vortex number over half an order of magnitude sym-\nmetrically aroundt, is shown in Fig. 2c (blue line). Unlike\nthe anomalous scaling observed over up to two orders of mag-\nnitude in time in [62], the higher initial vortex density here\naccelerates pair annihilations, whose sound emissions trigger\nan earlier crossover fromβ≈1/5 to diffusion-type scaling.\nDecaying inverse cascade.—Spatio-temporal scaling close\nto an NTFP is typically studied via correlation functions such\nas the angle-averaged single-particle momentum spectrum,\nn(k,t), which near the fixed point takes the scaling form\nn(k,t)=[t/t 0]αfs([t/t0]βk) with universal scaling function\nfs(k)=n(k,t 0) [43]. The temporal scaling dimensionsβof\nkandαoff s are usually constrained by a conservation law;\ne.g., of total particle number, which impliesα=dβinddi-\nmensions, whileβis fixed by the fixed point’s universality\nclass. Positiveβ >0 corresponds to transport toward lower\nmomenta, with a coarsening length scaleℓparametrizing the\nscaling function, e.g.,f s(k)∼(k 2\nℓ +k 2)−κ/2,k ℓ ∼ℓ −1 [51].\nFor suchf s, the high-momentum tail decays algebraically in\ntime,n(k≫k ℓ,t)∼[t/t 0]α−βκk−κ, ifκ > α/β[44]. As Fig. 4\nin App. B shows, the single-particle spectrum of our vortex\ngas obeys the above scaling form with a subdiffusive expo-\nnentβ=0.22(3) and the relationα≈2βsignals a particle-\nnumber conserving inverse flow towards lower momenta in\nthe form of a decaying cascade. At small momenta, while\nits extent into the infrared (IR) grows, higher occupancies are\nbuilt up asn(k≪k ℓ,0τ−β,t)∼τ α, with IR characteristic scale\nkℓ,0 =1/ℓv(0)≈0.05/a ho.\nTo better quantify the decaying cascade, we analyze the\nflow pattern in position space, where IR statistics are sup-\nported by more grid points than in momentum space. Specif-\nically, we study moments of the velocity circulation (1), for\nwhich we integrate the flow around square contoursC r,x of\nedge lengthr, with the lower-left corner atx, to match the grid\nsymmetry. Higher-order momentsΓ p(r)≡⟨N −1 P\nx |Γ(r,x)|p⟩\nare evaluated by averaging over all contours anchored atN=\n163842 lattice points and 20 TW A runs. For fully developed,\nnon-intermittent turbulence, the moments of the velocity cir-\nculation exhibit power-law scalingΓ p(r)∼r λp within the in-\nertial range. Kolmogorov’s theory of 3d turbulence predicts\nthe exponents to scale asλ p =4p/3, which also holds for\nan IEC in 2d, as can be inferred from the energy spectrum\nE(k)∼k −5/3 in Kraichnan-Leith-Batchelor theory [8–10].\nIn Fig. 2a, the second momentΓ 2(r) of the velocity circula-\ntion is shown over two orders of magnitude in time. At length\nscalesr≲ℓ v,f =ℓ v(tf), it scales asΓ 2(r)∼r 2, cf. the local\nlogarithmic derivative in the upper-left inset. The systematic\ndeviation from the expected value is likely due to the rather\nhigh vortex density. Evaluated at the initial-time inter-defect\ndistanceℓv,i ≡ℓv(t=t i)≈32a ho,t i =10 3(2π)/ωz, the circula-\ntion decays asΓ 2(ℓv,i)∼t −0.44±0.01, cf. lower-right inset, con-\nsistent with the decrease of the defect numberN v(t) (Fig. 2b,\nblue line). The vortex number scaling is recovered since the\nmoments do not distinguish vortices from antivortices, and in\na self-similarly coarsening vortex ensemble, the second mo-\nment remains approximately constant at the inter-defect dis-4\n101 103 104ξ ℓv\nr [aho]\n10□16\n10□8\n100\n108\n1016\n1024\n□p(r)/□p(ℓv)\n∼ r2\nt = 9 ·103 ·2π/ωz\n(a)\n3 ·102 3 ·103\nr [aho]\n8/3\n24/3\n40/3\n56/3\nd ln □p(r)\nd lnr\n0 16p\n0\n20λ□\np\n1.14p + 0.58\n4p/3\n103 104t0\nt [2π/ωz]\n10□1\n100\n101\n102\nℓp\nv(t)/ℓp\nv(t0)\n(b)\n3 ·103 2 ·104\nt [2π/ωz]\n1/5\n5/5\n9/5\nd lnℓp\nv(t)\nd lnt\n0 12p\n0\n2λℓv\np\np/5\n2 6 12 16p\n 1 3 9 11p\nFIG. 3. (a)pth-order moments of the velocity circulation, normalized at the inter-defect distanceℓ v, att=9·10 3(2π)/ωz. Between the\nhealing-lengthξand the inter-defect scaleℓ v we recover scaling asr 2. The inertial range is set to the highlighted interval 300<r/a ho <3000.\nThe upper-left inset shows the logarithmic derivatives of the moments using finite difference over two grid-spacings, which approach power-\nlaws within the inertial range, approximately given by 4p/3 (dashed lines). The lower-right inset shows the averaged scaling exponents within\nthe inertial range vs.p, which exhibit intermittent deviations from 4p/3 for higher moments. The deviations closely follow the linear function\n1.14p+0.58, as predicted for stationary IECs [78, 79]. (b) Higher-order moments of the average inter-defect distance distribution as a function\nof time, normalized att 0 =3·10 3(2π)/ωz. The upper-left inset displays the logarithmic derivatives, obtained similarly toβin Fig. 2c, which\napproach power-law behavior within the inertial range. In the lower-right inset the extracted scaling exponents closely followp/5, indicating\nthat the inter-defect distribution is nearly Gaussian and does not show ‘intermittent’ behavior.\ntance scale,Γ p(ℓv(t))≈const.. Hence, withℓ v(t)∼t β, one\nexpectsΓ 2(ℓv,i)= Γ 2(ℓv(t)(t/ti)−β)∼t −2β ∼N v(t). At length\nscalesr≫ℓ v,f =ℓv(tf), a steeper scaling emerges, with expo-\nnentλ2 ≈8/3 at intermediate times, cf. the upper-left inset.\nOur results demonstrate a spatially varying exponent in\nthis regime, yet it is striking that values aroundλ 2 =\nd lnΓ2(r)/dr≈8/3 appear to be attained by the maximum\nslopeλ2,max(t) during the time interval≈(3..20)t i (white area\nin Fig. 2c), coinciding with the regime whereβ≈1/5 sig-\nnals the approach of the anomalous NTFP. Hence, alongside\nthe scaling exponentβ, the emergence of universal dynam-\nics near the anomalous NTFP is accompanied by the buildup\nof a decaying inverse cascade, which exhibits spatial scaling\nwithλ 2 =8/3. This is also found by explicitly rescaling\nthe circulation probability distribution function, cf. Fig. 7 in\nApp. D 1. Further details on the transient behavior ofλ2,max(t)\nat the single-run level are given in App. D 2.\nIntermittency.—Evaluating higher moments ofΓ, we quan-\ntify deviations from the scaling withλ p =4p/3 due to inter-\nmittency. Fig. 3a showsΓ p(r)/Γp(ℓv) for even 2≤p≤16 at\nt=9t i, when universal scaling dynamics is fully developed.\nThe probability distribution functions in Fig. 8 of App. D 1\nconfirm statistical convergence for all chosenp. Below the\ninter-defect scale,r≪ℓ v, the area-law scaling∼r 2 is recov-\nered for all moments, whereas within the highlighted inertial\nrange{3...30}·10 2 aho, steeper power-law scaling emerges.\nIn the upper-left inset, the local logarithmic derivatives of\nthese moments approach values close to 4p/3 (dashed lines)\nwithin the inertial range, as expected from classical turbu-\nlence. Fitting power-laws in intervals of width 240a ho across\nthe inertial range and averaging, we extract scaling exponents\nwhich are shown, vs.p, in the lower-right inset. Compared\nto 4p/3, higher moments display intermittent deviations, re-\nflecting the non-Gaussian vortex statistics in the inertial range.\nThe red dashed line shows the bifractal intermittency model\nλp =hp+(2−D), forp>3, with experimentally determined\nHölder exponenth=1.14(2) and fractal dimensionD=1.42,\ncf. [78], which agrees within errors with our results. We per-\nform a similar analysis of the temporal scaling of the higher\nmoments of the average inter-defect distribution in Fig. 3b for\nall integer 1≤p≤11, cf. Fig. 9 for statistical convergence.\nWithin the universal time interval, all higher moments show\npower-law scaling with exponentsp/5, cf. the upper-left in-\nset, without clear intermittency deviations, cf. the lower-right\ninset. This indicates that the inter-defect distribution remains\nGaussian within the universal interval up to thep=11 mo-\nment, and no ‘temporal intermittency’ is observed.\nConclusions.—Starting from a large, randomly sampled\nvortex ensemble with net zero circulation in a dilute 2d su-\nperfluid Bose gas, we show that its dynamics in a closed sys-\ntem develops the spatial scaling characteristics of an inverse\nKraichnan-Kolmogorov cascade. The temporal loss of defects\ndue to vortex annihilations implies that the single-particle mo-\nmentum distribution of the Bose gas self-similarly shifts to\nsmaller wave numbers, thereby increasing the number of quasi\ncondensate particles at the lowest momenta, signalling the ap-\nproach of universal dynamics close to a NTFP. The evolution\nthus bears the characteristics of decaying 2d turbulence, in\nwhich the vortex pattern exhibits coarsening, with an alge-\nbraic increase of the mean inter-vortex distance asℓ v(t)∼t β.\nThe temporal coarsening exponent approachesβ≈1/5 dur-\ning the same period of time when the spatial velocity circula-5\ntion scales asΓ(r)∼r 4/3, indicating decaying Kraichnan-type\nturbulence. This exponent is distinctly smaller than what is\nfound in classical 2d turbulence for the dominant three-vortex\nscattering,β≈0.35, cf. [20, 28, 30, 80]. Moreover, thepth-\norder moments ofΓshow intermittent deviations from scaling\nas∼r 4p/3 , which is found to match intermittency in classical\nnon-decaying IECs [78, 79]. In contrast, the temporal scal-\ning of the average inter-defect distance was found to be non-\nintermittent up top=11. Our results demonstrate a close\nconnection between NTFPs and turbulence in quantum fluids.\nThey strongly motivate further research into the relevance of\nNTFPs in classical fluid turbulence.\nAcknowledgments.

Gross-Pitaevskii model in a quasi-2d geometry\nThe temporal evolution of a 3d single-component Bose gas at zero temperature is given by the nonlinear Gross-Pitaevskii\nequation (GPE),\niℏ∂Ψ(r,t)\n∂t =\n \n−ℏ2\n2m∇2 +V ext(r)+gρ(r,t)\n!\nΨ(r,t),(A1)\nwithρ(r,t)=|Ψ(r,t)| 2 the local 3d particle density with massmandV ext(r) the trapping potential. At low energies, the\nmicroscopic short-range interaction in 3d can be approximated by a local contact interaction with couplingg=4πℏ 2as/m,\nin terms of the 3ds-wave scattering lengtha s. For a homogeneous densityρ(r)=ρ, the chemical potential in mean-field\napproximation is given byµ=gρ, from which the healing lengthξ=ℏ/\np\n2mµis obtained.\nTo study quantum vortices in a quasi-2d geometry, we introduce an external trapping potentialV ext(r)=mω 2\nz z2/2 along the\nz-direction. This confines the system, using a trapping frequencyω z, to the characteristic width of the harmonic oscillatora ho =p\nℏ/(mωz). Ifa ho ≲ξ, the dynamics along thez-direction is effectively frozen out and the system is, to a good approximation, in\nthe single-particle ground state of the harmonic oscillator along thez-direction,\nh(z)= (πaho)−1/4 exp\n− z2\n2a2\nho\n.(A2)\nFactorizing the wave functionΨ(r,t)=ψ(r ⊥,t)h(z) into the planar contribution andh(z), thez-dependence can be integrated out\nexplicitly. This yields the quasi-2d GPE,\niℏ∂ψ(r⊥,t)\n∂t =\n \n−ℏ2\n2m∇2\n⊥+g 2ρ2(r⊥,t)\n!\nψ(r⊥,t),(A3)\nwith planar densityρ 2(r⊥,t)≡ |ψ(r ⊥,t)|2 and renormalized contact interactiong 2 =g/(\n√\n2πaho)=\n√\n8πℏ2as/(maho). For a\nhomogeneous densityρ2(r⊥,t)=ρ 2, the chemical potential is given byµ2 =g 2ρ2 =\n√\n8πℏ2asρ2/m, which defines the 2d healing\nlengthξ2 =1/k ξ2 =ℏ(2mµ 2)−1/2 =(4\n√\n2πasρ2/aho)−1/2. The latter sets the scale on which density modulations are restored in\nthe system and thus measures the vortex core size.\nWe solve the dynamics of the system using the semiclassical Truncated-Wigner approximation (TW A), in which initial field\nconfigurations with randomly sampled added noise are propagated with the above 2d GPE as classical equation of motion. The\nrandom noise is added to the phase of the Bogoliubov quasiparticle mode excitations with dispersionω(k),\nω(k)2 =ϵk (ϵk +2µ2) ,(A4)\nwith single-particle energyϵk =ℏ 2k2/(2m).6\n2. Units and parameters\nEq. (2) in the main text is expressed in dimensionless form, with length in units of [L]=a ho, time in [T]=1/ω z, and energy\nin [E]=ℏω z, with harmonic oscillator lengtha ho and trapping frequencyωz of the quasi-2d confinement along thez-axis. This\nis achieved by defining dimensionless coordinates, couplings and fields:\n˜x= x\naho\n, ˜k=ka ho , ˜t=ω zt, ˜ψ(˜r⊥,˜t)=ψ(r ⊥,t)a ho ,˜a s = as\naho\n.(A5)\nThis gives the dimensionless 2d coupling strength ˜g 2 =g 2m/ℏ2 =\n√\n8π˜as. Inserting this into (A3) yields the dimensionless\nquasi-2d GPE,\ni∂˜ψ(˜r⊥,˜t)\n∂˜t =\n \n−1\n2\n˜∇2 +\n√\n8π˜as ˜ρ2(˜r⊥,˜t)\n!\n˜ψ(˜r⊥,˜t).(A6)\nand after dropping the tildes and⊥Eq. (2).\nIn the following we list the parameter values chosen for the propagation of (A6). In order to observe the anomalous NTFP we\nadopted theultradiluteparameter regime introduced in [51, 62]. We start from the particle numberN=ρ 2L2 =3.2·10 9 and the\ndimensionless 2d coupling strength ˜g2 =\n√\n8π˜as =1.5·10 −5 as chosen, form=1/2, in [51]. Together with the linear system\nsize ˜L=L/a ho ≈1612 chosen in [62], the particle density is ˜ρ 2 =N/ ˜L2 ≈1232, which results in a dimensionless chemical\npotential\n˜µ2 =˜g2 ˜ρ2 ≈0.0184.(A7)\nThis choice satisfies the validity condition of the quasi-2d approximation, ˜ξ2 =1/\np\n2˜µ2 ≈5.2, to be sufficiently larger than 1.\nThe 3d diluteness parameter at the transverse peak density is\nη=\nq\n˜ρ3 ˜a3s =\nq\n˜ρ2 ˜g3\n2\n21/44π ≈1.4·10 −7 ,(A8)\nwhich quantifies the high diluteness of the system achieved by weak interactions and large occupancies. Since we perform our\nsimulations on 163842 numerical lattices, we enlarged the system to ˜L≈3.87·10 4 andN≈1.84·10 12, keeping the density and\nthe chemical potential fixed.\n3. Initialization and propagation\nWe initialize the 2d Bose gas in a square volume ˜V= ˜L2 with periodic boundary conditions, on aN=16384 2 numerical\nlattice, with an ensemble ofN v =1.4·10 6 randomly distributed vortices and antivortices with net zero winding number.\nWe choose the high initial vortex number to initiate the buildup of a spatial turbulent cascade and achieve a sufficient large-r\nresolution of the circulation correlators, cf. App. D 3 for a discussion of the further optimization of the defect number.\nThe field configuration is propagated using Eq. (A6) within the semi-classical TW A [86]. For this, we prepare the system by\nadding noise to the initial Bose field, in the form of an amplitude √1/2 and a random phase in each of the homogeneous-density\nBogoliubov quasiparticle momentum modes with energy (A4). The real-time evolution is computed up tot f =10 5(2π)/ωz,\nwith time step dt=0.1(2π)/ω z, using a split-step Fourier algorithm which accounts for the periodic boundary conditions. The\nresulting correlation functions are evaluated by averaging over 20 runs performed in a parallelized fashion using GPU clusters.\nWe emphasize that, other than in [79], we do not suppress compressible (sound) excitations, neither in the initial state nor during\nthe runs.\nAppendix B: Self-similar evolution of the occupation number spectra close to the non-thermal fixed point\nIn the main text, we have demonstrated the emergence of universal dynamics by the presence of coarsening manifest in the\nanomalously slow power-law decay of the mean vortex number and, equivalently, the algebraic growth of the mean inter-defect\ndistance asℓ v(t)∼t β, with an exponentβ=1/5, as introduced in [51], seen experimentally in [15], and extended to dipolar\nsystems in [62]. Beyond this, universal space-time scaling can be observed in the angle-averaged single-particle spectrumn(k,t),\nn(k,t)=\nZ\ndΩ⟨ψ∗(k−⟨k⟩,t)ψ(k−⟨k⟩,t)⟩,(B1)7\n10□3 10□2 10□1 100\n(t/t0)β k [1/aho]\n1011\n1012\n1013\n1014\n1015\n1016\n(t/t0)□α nk [a2\nho]\nα = 0.40 ± 0.03\nβ = 0.22 ± 0.03\n10□3 10□1 100kξkikf\nk [1/aho]\n1012\n1014\n1016\nnk [a2\nho]\nkmax(t0)\n104\n105t [2π/ωz]\nFIG. 4.

We emphasize that performing the angular integration about the centre-of-momentum\nmode⟨k⟩turned out to be crucial in order to recover self-similar scaling [62].\nIn the vicinity of a NTFP, the single-particle spectrum takes the universal scaling form\nn(k,t)=(t/t 0)αn([t/t0]βk,t 0)≡(t/t 0)αfs(k/kℓ(t)),(B2)\nwith universal scaling functionf s(k)=n(k,t 0) defined at the reference timet 0 and scaling exponentsαandβcharacterizing the\nfixed point. The IR momentum scale decreases as a power-lawk ℓ(t)∼(t/t 0)−β, corresponding to spatial coarsening, i.e., the\ngrowth of the characteristic length scale\nℓ(t)∼k ℓ(t)−1 ∼(t/t 0)β .(B3)\nFig. 4 shows the rescaling of ten spectra logarithmically spaced in time (lower-left inset) over the intervalt∈[10 4,10 5](2π)/ωz.\nThey are rescaled in the main plot using the scaling exponentsα=0.40±0.03 andβ=0.22±0.03, obtained with a least-square\nroutine put forward in [43]. These exponents agree with the subdiffusive scaling expected in the vicinity of the anomalous NTFP\ndescribed in [51, 62].

Fig. 4, which exceeds\nthe universal interval extracted from coarsening,t∈[3·10 3,2·10 4](2π)/ωz cf. Fig. 2. This difference is attributed to the scaling\nfunction not being fully developed when coarsening in the vortex number is already observed.\nAppendix C: Incompressible energy spectrum\nThroughout this work we have discussed the emergence of Kraichnan-Kolmogorov scaling in the moments of the velocity\ncirculation, cf. Fig. 2, since performing the analysis in position space provides a higher resolution of IR scales. Notwithstanding\nthis, turbulent scaling is usually also studied using the radial spectral energy distribution, which, in a stationary inverse cascade\nof a classical incompressible fluid ind=2, exhibits the scaling lawE(k)∼k −5/3 [8–10]. For our dilute superfluid, we expect to\nrecover the scaling behavior in the incompressible energy spectrum which we can determine by decomposing the kinetic energy\ninto a ‘classical’,E cl, and a ‘quantum’ part,E q, by means of the Madelung transformation of the field in terms of density and\nphase,\nEkin = 1\n2\nZ\nd2r |∇ψ(r)|2 = 1\n2\nZ\nd2r\n\f\f\f\f\np\nρ2(r)v(r)\n\f\f\f\f\n2\n|                       {z                       }\nEcl\n+ 1\n2\nZ\nd2r\n\f\f\f\f∇\np\nρ2(r)\n\f\f\f\f\n2\n|                    {z                    }\nEq\n.(C1)\nFollowing [88], we can furthermore Helmholtz decomposew cl = √ρ2 v=w ic +w c into a divergence-free, i.e., incompressible,\nand a curl free, compressible contribution, whereby the amplitude factor guarantees that the respective kinetic energies add up\ntoE cl. The contribution toE cl from the divergence free flow yields the incompressible kinetic energy\nEic = 1\n2\nZ\nd2r |wic(r)|2 = 1\n2π\nZ\ndk Eic(k),(C2)\nas well as its corresponding energy spectrumE ic(k), which is shown in Fig. 5 at logarithmically spaced times. Deep in the IR,\ni.e., below the inter-defect scale, the spectra exhibit a steeper scaling following the Kraichnan-Kolmogorov power-law∼k −5/3\nas can also be taken from the spectra multiplied byk 5/3 shown in the upper-right inset. At intermediate scales, between the\ninter-defect and the healing scale, we find the scaling∼k −1 of the velocity field of a single vortex. Beyond the healing scale, one\nwould expect the vortex core scaling∼k −3, which we, however, cannot reproduce due to our limited numerical resolution in the\nUV .\nAppendix D: Kraichnan-Kolmogorov scaling and intermittency in the higher moments of circulation\n1. Probability distribution functions\nFor the study of intermittency as shown in Fig. 3, we employed higher-order moments of the circulation (1) up to orderp=16\nand of the inter-defect distanceℓ v up top=11.

Assuming probability conservation\nwithin the interval [−ΓΛ,Γ Λ] set by the cutoff ΓΛ, yields the scaling relationsα t =β t andαr =β r. In Fig. 7 we have tested the\nscaling hypothesis (D1) explicitly by rescaling PDFs both spatially and temporally within the inertial range and the universal\ninterval, respectively. The spatial scaling exponentsαr =1.28±0.05 andβ r =1.30±0.03 agree well with the expected scaling\nofλ1 =4/3 for an inverse cascade. Likewise, the temporal scaling exponentsα t =0.22±0.05 andβ t =0.23±0.04 match the\nsubdiffusive exponentβ=1/5, and both scalings satisfy the relationα r,t ≈βr,t.

Hence we find similar vortex statistics as when\ndynamically cooling a Bose gas below the second-order condensation phase transition with ensuing vortex creation through the\nKibble-Zurek mechanism [89].\n2. Single-run comparisons ofλ 2,max andβ\nIn this appendix we provide more details on the observed transient behavior of the maximal local slopeλ2,max around 8/3 when\nthe system undergoes universal dynamics characterized by coarsening with an exponentβ=1/5. Fig. 2c shows the result we\nobtained after averaging over twenty individual runs, each starting withNv =1.4·10 6 defects. We complement this with Fig. 10,\nshowing the same quantities extracted from four individual runs of the simulation. These confirm the strong temporal correlation\nbetween universal dynamics close to the anomalous NTFP and spatial scaling according to an inverse Kraichnan-Kolmogorov\ncascade. All panels show a similar evolution of the temporal exponentβextracted from the decrease of the defect number.\nRegarding the maximum local logarithmic radial derivativeλ2,max we find, however, deviations on the single-run level. In run 1\n(a) and run 2 (b), the value 8/3 is reached right at the onset of the universal interval att≈3·10 3(2π)/ωz and remains very close\nfor less than half an order of magnitude in time. In contrast, run 3 (c) and run 4 (d) show similar early-time behavior but settle to\nexponents slightly larger than 8/3, where they remain stable until the end of the universal interval att≈2·10 4(2π)/ωz. These\nsmall variations between individual runs can be attributed to the randomness of the initial condition but have the disadvantageous\neffect that the data forλ 2,max is smeared out in the TW A average. For this reason we show the individual runs to highlight the\ncharacter of the transient behavior.\n3. Optimizing the number of defects\nIn the main text we have set the initial defect number toN v =1.4·10 6, as we will further motivate in this appendix. To this\nend we performed single-run evolutions on a smaller 81922 numerical grid, where we reduced the system length toL/2 and the12\nparticle number toN/4 in order to downsize the computational cost. Fig. 11 shows the same quantities as in Fig. 2c and Fig. 10\nfor the smaller system, with four different initial defect numbersN v ∈{300,350,400,450}·10 3. For the exponentβwe find\nthat at early timest≲3·10 3(2π)/ωz, increasing the vortex number leads to larger values, which can be explained by the initial\noverdensity of defects. During the universal interval,βnevertheless approaches the universal value≈1/5, before departing to\nlarger exponents att≳2·10 4(2π)/ωz, which also yields larger exponents for larger vortex numbers. This is explained by the\nincreased sound created on the background condensate, which then exerts friction on the defects, facilitating the transition to\nfaster coarsening [62].\nFor the circulation exponent, we find an earlier approach of Kraichnan-Kolmogorov value with increasing defect number\nwhich, however, also results in an earlier departure. The optimum balance between universal dynamics – best observed for\nsmaller vortex numbers – and the transient behavior of the Kraichnan IEC – best observed for larger vortex number – is around\nNv =350·10 3, cf. Fig. 11c. Multiplying this value by four results in the number used in the main text for the system of fourfold\nsize.\n[1] U. Frisch,Turbulence: The Legacy of A. N.

The decay exponentβclearly deviates from values known for classical systems.\nIntroduction.—Fluid turbulence has been among the first\nsystems used to study spatial and temporal scaling phenom-\nena in nature [1–7]. In three spatial dimensions, driven, fully\ndeveloped turbulence has been characterized as a direct cas-\ncade, in which kinetic energy is transferred from large to small\nspatial scales through an inertial range, establishing the sta-\ntionary spectral distributionE(k)∼k −5/3. In contrast, re-\nstricting the dynamics to a (quasi-)2d geometry, the energy\nis transported in the opposite direction as large-scale eddies\nare formed from smaller ones, which forms an inverse cas-\ncade, giving rise to the same stationary algebraic momentum\ndistribution,E(k)∼k −5/3 [8–10]. On scales where quantum\nstatistics and coherence prevail, superfluid or quantum turbu-\nlence emerges in inviscid superfluids, including 4He and di-\nlute Bose-Einstein condensates [11–14]. The elementary con-\nstituents of the flow are quantum vortices, carrying point-like\nvorticity with discrete valuesqh/m,q∈Z. They thus differ\nfrom classical eddies in their microscopic properties, while\non large scales certain characteristics of classical fluid turbu-\nlence, like the inverse energy cascade (IEC) in two dimen-\nsions, have been recovered in superfluids [15–17].\nWhile the standard setting discussed is fully developed tur-\nbulence, where the driving introduces as much energy per\nunit time as is lost at the dissipative end of the inertial range,\ne.g., to thermal excitations, other scenarios of interest are the\nbuildup and decay of a turbulent cascade. Of particular rele-\nvance in this regard is the evolution within a closed system,\ni.e., without energy and particle gain and loss. As for classi-\ncal 3d [18, 19] as well as 2d turbulence [20–32] the decay of\nturbulence has been discussed for and measured in quantum\nsystems, cf., e.g., [33, 34]. In 2d, studies of decaying quan-\ntum turbulence have focused on Onsager-Kraichnan conden-\nsation of vortex clusters and the loss of vortex-antivortex pairs\n[35–37], the direct enstrophy cascade [38], and finite temper-\natures [39]. The latter work examined the scaling evolution\nof single-particle spectra, vortex number, and inter-defect dis-\ntance, characterizing the vortex decay and scaling evolution\n∗niklas.rasch@kip.uni-heidelberg.de\n†t.gasenzer@uni-heidelberg.de\nas universal dynamics near a non-thermal fixed point (NTFP)\n[40–44], see [39, 45–62] in the context of vortex dynamics.\nIn analogy to the theory of equilibrium critical phenomena,\nuniversal scaling dynamics has been proposed to be associ-\nated with NTFPs, see [63–66] for overviews. These fixed\npoints are thought to result from considering time evolution\nas a renormalization-group flow, classifying space-time scal-\ning based on symmetries and the character of the field config-\nurations. Recent experiments have explored various phenom-\nena and properties of universal space-time scaling, largely in\nultracold gases [15, 67–77].\nMain result.—We show that the appearance of the anoma-\nlous NTFP in a dilute 2d superfluid [51, 62] is directly re-\nlated to the decay of quantum turbulence, exhibiting long-\nrange spatial scaling of the second moment of velocity circu-\nlationΓaccording to the Kolmogorov-Kraichnan power-law\nΓ2(r)∼r 8/3. Moreover, we find the scaling of higher mo-\nments of the velocity circulation to show intermittent devia-\ntions consistent with the bifractal intermittency model studied\nin stationary IECs [78, 79]. In contrast, vortex separation is\nfound to remain Gaussian distributed throughout the universal\ndynamics and does not exhibit intermittent behavior in time.\nIn turn, the decaying 2d quantum turbulence in the closed sys-\ntem is characterized by a growth of the inter-defect distance,\nℓv ∼t β, with an anomalously small, subdiffusive exponent\nβ≈1/5, distinctly smaller than what is known from classical\nturbulence [80]. The vortex pattern coarsening is associated\nwith an inverse cascade of the kinetic energy of incompress-\nible fluid flow, exhibiting classical scaling, which decays and\nthereby expands further to lower momenta according to the\nconservation law associated with the NTFP. Our results link\nsuperfluid turbulence in a closed 2d system, on the grounds of\na high-resolution analysis in the spatial domain, to the concept\nof NTFPs in far-from-equilibrium dynamics.\nNon-thermal fixed points vs. turbulence.—For single-com-\nponent, scalar quantum field theories universal dynamics near\nNTFPs is usually dominated by nonlinear excitations of the to-\ntal density such as vortices, solitons, or kinks [15, 39, 45–62].\nThe spatio-temporal coarsening of the field pattern is reflected\nin the loss of these excitations, and the length scaleℓ(t)∼t β\nis typically associated with the mean inter-defect distance.

The system approaches\nspace-time scaling near the anomalous NTFP within the time intervalt≈(0.3...2)·10 4(2π)/ωz, corresponding to a decaying turbulent cascade,\ntogether with spatial scaling characteristics akin to 2d fully developed turbulence. The insets show the corresponding snapshots of the density\nnormalized to its spatial average,ρ2/⟨ρ2⟩.\nandβ≈1/2, corresponding to an anomalous and a Gaussian\nNTFP, respectively, are found [15, 39, 48, 50–52, 55, 56, 60–\n62]. These reflect different vortex annihilation processes:\nβ=1/2 arises from friction due to interaction with sound\nexcitations, causing direct vortex-antivortex annihilations ac-\ncording to a two-body scattering rate. In contrast,β=1/5 re-\nsults for annihilations relying on three-vortex processes bring-\ning the vortex pairs of opposite circulation sufficiently close to\neach other. At early times and low temperatures, before vor-\ntex annihilations generate thermalizing sound noise, the sub-\ndiffusive exponent dominates [15, 51, 52, 56, 60–62].\nIn turbulence, an important observable besides energy spec-\ntra is the statistics of velocity increments,δv r(x)=v(x+r)−\nv(x), which are Gaussian for larger=|r|[1] but develop\nheavy tails at smaller scales. These deviations, termed inter-\nmittency [81], are quantified by higher-order structure func-\ntionsS p(r)=⟨|δv r(x)|p⟩, which scale asS p(r)∼r ζp with\nζ1 =1/3 in a fully developed 2d IEC. The higher exponents\nhave been found both numerically [82] and experimentally\n[83] to scale asζ p =p/3, implying the absence of intermit-\ntency, unlike 3d turbulence [84]. Instead of velocity incre-\nments, however, the moments of the velocity circulation,\nΓ(r,x)=\nI\nCr,x\nvdl,(1)\nevaluated along a pathCr,x, e.g., a circle of radiusraround the\npointx[85], exhibit intermittency in the IEC, as seen in ex-\nperiments [78] and simulations [79]. Velocity circulations are\nof particular interest in quantum turbulence since, by Stokes’\ntheorem, they equal area integrals of quantized vorticity, i.e.,\nthe net circulation of vortices within a given area.\n2d Bose gas.—We consider a single-component 2d dilute\nsuperfluid in the vicinity of the anomalous NTFP, exhibiting\nsubdiffusive scaling (β≈1/5≪1/2) [51, 62]. Its dynamics\nis defined by the 2d Gross-Pitaevskii equation (GPE),\ni∂tψ(r,t)=\n\u0010\n−∇2/2+g 2 ρ2(r,t)\n\u0011\nψ(r,t),(2)\nwhereρ 2(r,t)=|ψ(r,t)| 2 is the local 2d density andg 2 the\ndimensionless coupling, cf. App. A for details of parameters\nand units. We initialize the 2d Bose gas in a square vol-\nume with periodic boundary conditions, using an ensemble\nofN v =1.4·10 6 randomly distributed (anti)vortices with zero\nnet winding. Fig. 1a shows an example of the corresponding\nnormalized current,j=ρ 2v=ρ 2∇θand density field from\nψ= √ρ2eiθ. The field is propagated via Eq. (2) using the\nsemi-classical Truncated-Wigner approximation (TW A) [86],\ncf. App. A 3 for details of initialization and propagation.\nVortex pattern coarsening close to the anomalous NTFP.—\nFig. 1 shows four snapshots of the system for an exemplary\nrun, see [87] for a video. The current exhibits vortex clusters\nsurrounded by strong coherent flows, which weaken in time\nalong with the coarsening of the vortex pattern, also reflected\nin the growing density variation patterns. Choosing a high\ninitial vortex number, transport to lower wave numbers and\nthus the mutual annihilation of vortices and antivortices sets in\nquickly, while achieving a sufficient large-rresolution of the\ncirculation correlators. By the timet≈10 3(2π)/ωz, shown\nin Fig. 1b, the dynamics has lead from the non-equilibrium\ninitial condition to the build-up of a turbulent cascade, which\nexhibits decay due to the lack of external driving.\nWe find the coarsening to be characterized by an algebraic\ntime evolution of the mean inter-defect, i.e., the shortest dis-\ntance between a vortex and its neighbor,ℓv(t)∼t β, and of the\nmean vortex number,N v(t)∼t −2β, cf. Fig. 2b. After an initial\nbuildup phase, the scaling exponent takes the subdiffusion-\ntype valueβ≈1/5, consistent with the anomalous NTFP de-\nscribed in [51, 62] and remains approximately constant within\nthe time interval 3·10 3 ≲(2π) −1ωzt≲2·10 4. At later times,\ncf. Fig. 1d, the vortex number decay departs from anoma-\nlous scaling due to an increased presence of sound excitations\nfostering two-body vortex annihilations, withβeffectively\nincreasing (cf. Fig. 2b) until the system eventually reaches\ndiffusion-type scaling withβ≈1/2 [51, 62].

(c) Comparison of the\nfitted time-dependentβexponent extracted from the vortex number in (b) and the maximal local slopeλ 2,max from (a). The system approaches\nuniversal dynamics, indicated byβ≈1/5, at the highlighted intermediate times, which is accompanied by the buildup of a transient 2d\nturbulent Kolmogorov-Kraichnan scaling corresponding to a decaying IEC.\ndecaying vortex number over half an order of magnitude sym-\nmetrically aroundt, is shown in Fig. 2c (blue line). Unlike\nthe anomalous scaling observed over up to two orders of mag-\nnitude in time in [62], the higher initial vortex density here\naccelerates pair annihilations, whose sound emissions trigger\nan earlier crossover fromβ≈1/5 to diffusion-type scaling.\nDecaying inverse cascade.—Spatio-temporal scaling close\nto an NTFP is typically studied via correlation functions such\nas the angle-averaged single-particle momentum spectrum,\nn(k,t), which near the fixed point takes the scaling form\nn(k,t)=[t/t 0]αfs([t/t0]βk) with universal scaling function\nfs(k)=n(k,t 0) [43]. The temporal scaling dimensionsβof\nkandαoff s are usually constrained by a conservation law;\ne.g., of total particle number, which impliesα=dβinddi-\nmensions, whileβis fixed by the fixed point’s universality\nclass. Positiveβ >0 corresponds to transport toward lower\nmomenta, with a coarsening length scaleℓparametrizing the\nscaling function, e.g.,f s(k)∼(k 2\nℓ +k 2)−κ/2,k ℓ ∼ℓ −1 [51].\nFor suchf s, the high-momentum tail decays algebraically in\ntime,n(k≫k ℓ,t)∼[t/t 0]α−βκk−κ, ifκ > α/β[44]. As Fig. 4\nin App. B shows, the single-particle spectrum of our vortex\ngas obeys the above scaling form with a subdiffusive expo-\nnentβ=0.22(3) and the relationα≈2βsignals a particle-\nnumber conserving inverse flow towards lower momenta in\nthe form of a decaying cascade. At small momenta, while\nits extent into the infrared (IR) grows, higher occupancies are\nbuilt up asn(k≪k ℓ,0τ−β,t)∼τ α, with IR characteristic scale\nkℓ,0 =1/ℓv(0)≈0.05/a ho.\nTo better quantify the decaying cascade, we analyze the\nflow pattern in position space, where IR statistics are sup-\nported by more grid points than in momentum space. Specif-\nically, we study moments of the velocity circulation (1), for\nwhich we integrate the flow around square contoursC r,x of\nedge lengthr, with the lower-left corner atx, to match the grid\nsymmetry. Higher-order momentsΓ p(r)≡⟨N −1 P\nx |Γ(r,x)|p⟩\nare evaluated by averaging over all contours anchored atN=\n163842 lattice points and 20 TW A runs. For fully developed,\nnon-intermittent turbulence, the moments of the velocity cir-\nculation exhibit power-law scalingΓ p(r)∼r λp within the in-\nertial range. Kolmogorov’s theory of 3d turbulence predicts\nthe exponents to scale asλ p =4p/3, which also holds for\nan IEC in 2d, as can be inferred from the energy spectrum\nE(k)∼k −5/3 in Kraichnan-Leith-Batchelor theory [8–10].\nIn Fig. 2a, the second momentΓ 2(r) of the velocity circula-\ntion is shown over two orders of magnitude in time. At length\nscalesr≲ℓ v,f =ℓ v(tf), it scales asΓ 2(r)∼r 2, cf. the local\nlogarithmic derivative in the upper-left inset. The systematic\ndeviation from the expected value is likely due to the rather\nhigh vortex density. Evaluated at the initial-time inter-defect\ndistanceℓv,i ≡ℓv(t=t i)≈32a ho,t i =10 3(2π)/ωz, the circula-\ntion decays asΓ 2(ℓv,i)∼t −0.44±0.01, cf. lower-right inset, con-\nsistent with the decrease of the defect numberN v(t) (Fig. 2b,\nblue line). The vortex number scaling is recovered since the\nmoments do not distinguish vortices from antivortices, and in\na self-similarly coarsening vortex ensemble, the second mo-\nment remains approximately constant at the inter-defect dis-4\n101 103 104ξ ℓv\nr [aho]\n10□16\n10□8\n100\n108\n1016\n1024\n□p(r)/□p(ℓv)\n∼ r2\nt = 9 ·103 ·2π/ωz\n(a)\n3 ·102 3 ·103\nr [aho]\n8/3\n24/3\n40/3\n56/3\nd ln □p(r)\nd lnr\n0 16p\n0\n20λ□\np\n1.14p + 0.58\n4p/3\n103 104t0\nt [2π/ωz]\n10□1\n100\n101\n102\nℓp\nv(t)/ℓp\nv(t0)\n(b)\n3 ·103 2 ·104\nt [2π/ωz]\n1/5\n5/5\n9/5\nd lnℓp\nv(t)\nd lnt\n0 12p\n0\n2λℓv\np\np/5\n2 6 12 16p\n 1 3 9 11p\nFIG. 3.

The inertial range is set to the highlighted interval 300<r/a ho <3000.\nThe upper-left inset shows the logarithmic derivatives of the moments using finite difference over two grid-spacings, which approach power-\nlaws within the inertial range, approximately given by 4p/3 (dashed lines). The lower-right inset shows the averaged scaling exponents within\nthe inertial range vs.p, which exhibit intermittent deviations from 4p/3 for higher moments. The deviations closely follow the linear function\n1.14p+0.58, as predicted for stationary IECs [78, 79]. (b) Higher-order moments of the average inter-defect distance distribution as a function\nof time, normalized att 0 =3·10 3(2π)/ωz. The upper-left inset displays the logarithmic derivatives, obtained similarly toβin Fig. 2c, which\napproach power-law behavior within the inertial range. In the lower-right inset the extracted scaling exponents closely followp/5, indicating\nthat the inter-defect distribution is nearly Gaussian and does not show ‘intermittent’ behavior.\ntance scale,Γ p(ℓv(t))≈const.. Hence, withℓ v(t)∼t β, one\nexpectsΓ 2(ℓv,i)= Γ 2(ℓv(t)(t/ti)−β)∼t −2β ∼N v(t). At length\nscalesr≫ℓ v,f =ℓv(tf), a steeper scaling emerges, with expo-\nnentλ2 ≈8/3 at intermediate times, cf. the upper-left inset.\nOur results demonstrate a spatially varying exponent in\nthis regime, yet it is striking that values aroundλ 2 =\nd lnΓ2(r)/dr≈8/3 appear to be attained by the maximum\nslopeλ2,max(t) during the time interval≈(3..20)t i (white area\nin Fig. 2c), coinciding with the regime whereβ≈1/5 sig-\nnals the approach of the anomalous NTFP. Hence, alongside\nthe scaling exponentβ, the emergence of universal dynam-\nics near the anomalous NTFP is accompanied by the buildup\nof a decaying inverse cascade, which exhibits spatial scaling\nwithλ 2 =8/3. This is also found by explicitly rescaling\nthe circulation probability distribution function, cf. Fig. 7 in\nApp. D 1. Further details on the transient behavior ofλ2,max(t)\nat the single-run level are given in App. D 2.\nIntermittency.—Evaluating higher moments ofΓ, we quan-\ntify deviations from the scaling withλ p =4p/3 due to inter-\nmittency. Fig. 3a showsΓ p(r)/Γp(ℓv) for even 2≤p≤16 at\nt=9t i, when universal scaling dynamics is fully developed.\nThe probability distribution functions in Fig. 8 of App. D 1\nconfirm statistical convergence for all chosenp. Below the\ninter-defect scale,r≪ℓ v, the area-law scaling∼r 2 is recov-\nered for all moments, whereas within the highlighted inertial\nrange{3...30}·10 2 aho, steeper power-law scaling emerges.\nIn the upper-left inset, the local logarithmic derivatives of\nthese moments approach values close to 4p/3 (dashed lines)\nwithin the inertial range, as expected from classical turbu-\nlence. Fitting power-laws in intervals of width 240a ho across\nthe inertial range and averaging, we extract scaling exponents\nwhich are shown, vs.p, in the lower-right inset. Compared\nto 4p/3, higher moments display intermittent deviations, re-\nflecting the non-Gaussian vortex statistics in the inertial range.\nThe red dashed line shows the bifractal intermittency model\nλp =hp+(2−D), forp>3, with experimentally determined\nHölder exponenth=1.14(2) and fractal dimensionD=1.42,\ncf. [78], which agrees within errors with our results. We per-\nform a similar analysis of the temporal scaling of the higher\nmoments of the average inter-defect distribution in Fig. 3b for\nall integer 1≤p≤11, cf. Fig. 9 for statistical convergence.\nWithin the universal time interval, all higher moments show\npower-law scaling with exponentsp/5, cf. the upper-left in-\nset, without clear intermittency deviations, cf. the lower-right\ninset. This indicates that the inter-defect distribution remains\nGaussian within the universal interval up to thep=11 mo-\nment, and no ‘temporal intermittency’ is observed.\nConclusions.—Starting from a large, randomly sampled\nvortex ensemble with net zero circulation in a dilute 2d su-\nperfluid Bose gas, we show that its dynamics in a closed sys-\ntem develops the spatial scaling characteristics of an inverse\nKraichnan-Kolmogorov cascade. The temporal loss of defects\ndue to vortex annihilations implies that the single-particle mo-\nmentum distribution of the Bose gas self-similarly shifts to\nsmaller wave numbers, thereby increasing the number of quasi\ncondensate particles at the lowest momenta, signalling the ap-\nproach of universal dynamics close to a NTFP. The evolution\nthus bears the characteristics of decaying 2d turbulence, in\nwhich the vortex pattern exhibits coarsening, with an alge-\nbraic increase of the mean inter-vortex distance asℓ v(t)∼t β.\nThe temporal coarsening exponent approachesβ≈1/5 dur-\ning the same period of time when the spatial velocity circula-5\ntion scales asΓ(r)∼r 4/3, indicating decaying Kraichnan-type\nturbulence. This exponent is distinctly smaller than what is\nfound in classical 2d turbulence for the dominant three-vortex\nscattering,β≈0.35, cf. [20, 28, 30, 80]. Moreover, thepth-\norder moments ofΓshow intermittent deviations from scaling\nas∼r 4p/3 , which is found to match intermittency in classical\nnon-decaying IECs [78, 79]. In contrast, the temporal scal-\ning of the average inter-defect distance was found to be non-\nintermittent up top=11. Our results demonstrate a close\nconnection between NTFPs and turbulence in quantum fluids.\nThey strongly motivate further research into the relevance of\nNTFPs in classical fluid turbulence.\nAcknowledgments.

For a\nhomogeneous densityρ2(r⊥,t)=ρ 2, the chemical potential is given byµ2 =g 2ρ2 =\n√\n8πℏ2asρ2/m, which defines the 2d healing\nlengthξ2 =1/k ξ2 =ℏ(2mµ 2)−1/2 =(4\n√\n2πasρ2/aho)−1/2. The latter sets the scale on which density modulations are restored in\nthe system and thus measures the vortex core size.\nWe solve the dynamics of the system using the semiclassical Truncated-Wigner approximation (TW A), in which initial field\nconfigurations with randomly sampled added noise are propagated with the above 2d GPE as classical equation of motion. The\nrandom noise is added to the phase of the Bogoliubov quasiparticle mode excitations with dispersionω(k),\nω(k)2 =ϵk (ϵk +2µ2) ,(A4)\nwith single-particle energyϵk =ℏ 2k2/(2m).6\n2. Units and parameters\nEq.

This\nis achieved by defining dimensionless coordinates, couplings and fields:\n˜x= x\naho\n, ˜k=ka ho , ˜t=ω zt, ˜ψ(˜r⊥,˜t)=ψ(r ⊥,t)a ho ,˜a s = as\naho\n.(A5)\nThis gives the dimensionless 2d coupling strength ˜g 2 =g 2m/ℏ2 =\n√\n8π˜as.

(2).\nIn the following we list the parameter values chosen for the propagation of (A6). In order to observe the anomalous NTFP we\nadopted theultradiluteparameter regime introduced in [51, 62]. We start from the particle numberN=ρ 2L2 =3.2·10 9 and the\ndimensionless 2d coupling strength ˜g2 =\n√\n8π˜as =1.5·10 −5 as chosen, form=1/2, in [51]. Together with the linear system\nsize ˜L=L/a ho ≈1612 chosen in [62], the particle density is ˜ρ 2 =N/ ˜L2 ≈1232, which results in a dimensionless chemical\npotential\n˜µ2 =˜g2 ˜ρ2 ≈0.0184.(A7)\nThis choice satisfies the validity condition of the quasi-2d approximation, ˜ξ2 =1/\np\n2˜µ2 ≈5.2, to be sufficiently larger than 1.\nThe 3d diluteness parameter at the transverse peak density is\nη=\nq\n˜ρ3 ˜a3s =\nq\n˜ρ2 ˜g3\n2\n21/44π ≈1.4·10 −7 ,(A8)\nwhich quantifies the high diluteness of the system achieved by weak interactions and large occupancies. Since we perform our\nsimulations on 163842 numerical lattices, we enlarged the system to ˜L≈3.87·10 4 andN≈1.84·10 12, keeping the density and\nthe chemical potential fixed.\n3. Initialization and propagation\nWe initialize the 2d Bose gas in a square volume ˜V= ˜L2 with periodic boundary conditions, on aN=16384 2 numerical\nlattice, with an ensemble ofN v =1.4·10 6 randomly distributed vortices and antivortices with net zero winding number.\nWe choose the high initial vortex number to initiate the buildup of a spatial turbulent cascade and achieve a sufficient large-r\nresolution of the circulation correlators, cf. App. D 3 for a discussion of the further optimization of the defect number.\nThe field configuration is propagated using Eq. (A6) within the semi-classical TW A [86]. For this, we prepare the system by\nadding noise to the initial Bose field, in the form of an amplitude √1/2 and a random phase in each of the homogeneous-density\nBogoliubov quasiparticle momentum modes with energy (A4). The real-time evolution is computed up tot f =10 5(2π)/ωz,\nwith time step dt=0.1(2π)/ω z, using a split-step Fourier algorithm which accounts for the periodic boundary conditions. The\nresulting correlation functions are evaluated by averaging over 20 runs performed in a parallelized fashion using GPU clusters.\nWe emphasize that, other than in [79], we do not suppress compressible (sound) excitations, neither in the initial state nor during\nthe runs.\nAppendix B: Self-similar evolution of the occupation number spectra close to the non-thermal fixed point\nIn the main text, we have demonstrated the emergence of universal dynamics by the presence of coarsening manifest in the\nanomalously slow power-law decay of the mean vortex number and, equivalently, the algebraic growth of the mean inter-defect\ndistance asℓ v(t)∼t β, with an exponentβ=1/5, as introduced in [51], seen experimentally in [15], and extended to dipolar\nsystems in [62].

We emphasize that performing the angular integration about the centre-of-momentum\nmode⟨k⟩turned out to be crucial in order to recover self-similar scaling [62].\nIn the vicinity of a NTFP, the single-particle spectrum takes the universal scaling form\nn(k,t)=(t/t 0)αn([t/t0]βk,t 0)≡(t/t 0)αfs(k/kℓ(t)),(B2)\nwith universal scaling functionf s(k)=n(k,t 0) defined at the reference timet 0 and scaling exponentsαandβcharacterizing the\nfixed point.

Fig. 4, which exceeds\nthe universal interval extracted from coarsening,t∈[3·10 3,2·10 4](2π)/ωz cf. Fig. 2. This difference is attributed to the scaling\nfunction not being fully developed when coarsening in the vortex number is already observed.\nAppendix C: Incompressible energy spectrum\nThroughout this work we have discussed the emergence of Kraichnan-Kolmogorov scaling in the moments of the velocity\ncirculation, cf. Fig. 2, since performing the analysis in position space provides a higher resolution of IR scales. Notwithstanding\nthis, turbulent scaling is usually also studied using the radial spectral energy distribution, which, in a stationary inverse cascade\nof a classical incompressible fluid ind=2, exhibits the scaling lawE(k)∼k −5/3 [8–10]. For our dilute superfluid, we expect to\nrecover the scaling behavior in the incompressible energy spectrum which we can determine by decomposing the kinetic energy\ninto a ‘classical’,E cl, and a ‘quantum’ part,E q, by means of the Madelung transformation of the field in terms of density and\nphase,\nEkin = 1\n2\nZ\nd2r |∇ψ(r)|2 = 1\n2\nZ\nd2r\n\f\f\f\f\np\nρ2(r)v(r)\n\f\f\f\f\n2\n|                       {z                       }\nEcl\n+ 1\n2\nZ\nd2r\n\f\f\f\f∇\np\nρ2(r)\n\f\f\f\f\n2\n|                    {z                    }\nEq\n.(C1)\nFollowing [88], we can furthermore Helmholtz decomposew cl = √ρ2 v=w ic +w c into a divergence-free, i.e., incompressible,\nand a curl free, compressible contribution, whereby the amplitude factor guarantees that the respective kinetic energies add up\ntoE cl. The contribution toE cl from the divergence free flow yields the incompressible kinetic energy\nEic = 1\n2\nZ\nd2r |wic(r)|2 = 1\n2π\nZ\ndk Eic(k),(C2)\nas well as its corresponding energy spectrumE ic(k), which is shown in Fig. 5 at logarithmically spaced times. Deep in the IR,\ni.e., below the inter-defect scale, the spectra exhibit a steeper scaling following the Kraichnan-Kolmogorov power-law∼k −5/3\nas can also be taken from the spectra multiplied byk 5/3 shown in the upper-right inset. At intermediate scales, between the\ninter-defect and the healing scale, we find the scaling∼k −1 of the velocity field of a single vortex. Beyond the healing scale, one\nwould expect the vortex core scaling∼k −3, which we, however, cannot reproduce due to our limited numerical resolution in the\nUV .\nAppendix D: Kraichnan-Kolmogorov scaling and intermittency in the higher moments of circulation\n1. Probability distribution functions\nFor the study of intermittency as shown in Fig. 3, we employed higher-order moments of the circulation (1) up to orderp=16\nand of the inter-defect distanceℓ v up top=11.

In Fig. 6 we show the obtained PDFs att=9·10 3(2π)/ωz for five values ofr/ℓ v chosen (a)\n∈{0.2,0.4,0.6,0.8,1.0}and (b)∈{2,4,6,8,10}, which exhibit growing probabilities for larger circulations as the radii increase.\nSince the PDFs are expected to obey Gaussian statistics for ‘small’ circulationsΓwe can postulate a scaling hypothesis\nP(Γ/(2π),r,t)=(r/r 0)−αr (t/t0)αt P((r/r0)−βr (t/t0)βt Γ/(2π),r 0,t 0) (D1)\nboth in space and time with spatial,α r andβr, and temporal,α t andβt, scaling exponents.

Hence we find similar vortex statistics as when\ndynamically cooling a Bose gas below the second-order condensation phase transition with ensuing vortex creation through the\nKibble-Zurek mechanism [89].\n2. Single-run comparisons ofλ 2,max andβ\nIn this appendix we provide more details on the observed transient behavior of the maximal local slopeλ2,max around 8/3 when\nthe system undergoes universal dynamics characterized by coarsening with an exponentβ=1/5. Fig. 2c shows the result we\nobtained after averaging over twenty individual runs, each starting withNv =1.4·10 6 defects. We complement this with Fig. 10,\nshowing the same quantities extracted from four individual runs of the simulation. These confirm the strong temporal correlation\nbetween universal dynamics close to the anomalous NTFP and spatial scaling according to an inverse Kraichnan-Kolmogorov\ncascade. All panels show a similar evolution of the temporal exponentβextracted from the decrease of the defect number.\nRegarding the maximum local logarithmic radial derivativeλ2,max we find, however, deviations on the single-run level. In run 1\n(a) and run 2 (b), the value 8/3 is reached right at the onset of the universal interval att≈3·10 3(2π)/ωz and remains very close\nfor less than half an order of magnitude in time. In contrast, run 3 (c) and run 4 (d) show similar early-time behavior but settle to\nexponents slightly larger than 8/3, where they remain stable until the end of the universal interval att≈2·10 4(2π)/ωz. These\nsmall variations between individual runs can be attributed to the randomness of the initial condition but have the disadvantageous\neffect that the data forλ 2,max is smeared out in the TW A average. For this reason we show the individual runs to highlight the\ncharacter of the transient behavior.\n3. Optimizing the number of defects\nIn the main text we have set the initial defect number toN v =1.4·10 6, as we will further motivate in this appendix. To this\nend we performed single-run evolutions on a smaller 81922 numerical grid, where we reduced the system length toL/2 and the12\nparticle number toN/4 in order to downsize the computational cost. Fig. 11 shows the same quantities as in Fig. 2c and Fig. 10\nfor the smaller system, with four different initial defect numbersN v ∈{300,350,400,450}·10 3. For the exponentβwe find\nthat at early timest≲3·10 3(2π)/ωz, increasing the vortex number leads to larger values, which can be explained by the initial\noverdensity of defects. During the universal interval,βnevertheless approaches the universal value≈1/5, before departing to\nlarger exponents att≳2·10 4(2π)/ωz, which also yields larger exponents for larger vortex numbers. This is explained by the\nincreased sound created on the background condensate, which then exerts friction on the defects, facilitating the transition to\nfaster coarsening [62].\nFor the circulation exponent, we find an earlier approach of Kraichnan-Kolmogorov value with increasing defect number\nwhich, however, also results in an earlier departure. The optimum balance between universal dynamics – best observed for\nsmaller vortex numbers – and the transient behavior of the Kraichnan IEC – best observed for larger vortex number – is around\nNv =350·10 3, cf. Fig. 11c. Multiplying this value by four results in the number used in the main text for the system of fourfold\nsize.\n[1] U. Frisch,Turbulence: The Legacy of A. N.

We show the projected sensitivity at DESI with\nthe typical phase space distribution of a freeze-in DM scenario as illustration.\nIntroduction– The DM plays very important roles\nin the evolution and structure formation of our Universe\n[1–3]. For redshiftz≳10 when the dark energy has\nnot started to dominate, the behavior and history of our\nUniverse is mainly determined by radiation and matter.\nOf the later, more than 80% are contributed by DM while\nthe remaining by the ordinary matter. To be exact, DM\nis more than 5 times of the ordinary matter. It is then\na fair question to ask whether the DM has just a single\ntype or actually possesses multiple components. Since\nthe ordinary matter world is already a combination of\nvarious isotopes that are formed by at least three building\nblocks (proton, neutron, and electron), it is natural for\nthe DM sector to also have several species.\nThe particle physics provides various DM candidates\n[4, 5] that are not just conceptually neat with unified\nquantum field theory description in the same way as the\nordinary matter but also very simple with typically just\nmass and coupling strength as the only parameters to\nexplain the observed DM phenomena from both astron-\nomy and cosmology. Of them, the particular interest-\ning ones include the Weakly Interacting Massive Parti-\ncles (WIMP) [6–10] that participate the weak gauge in-\nteractions with mass typically at GeV∼TeV, the sterile\nneutrino at keV scale [11–19] suggested by the observed\nanomalies in neutrino oscillation experiments and astro-\nphysical observations, and the axion [20–22] motivated\nby the strong CP problem with even lighter mass. The\nmass spectrum of particle DM candidates spans around\n100 orders from the smallest fuzzy DM at 10−22 eV to the\nastrophysical primordial black holes (PBH) with masses\nof 1050 g (∼10 88 eV) [23]. It is possible for the DM can-\ndidates to have totally different masses.\nBesides mass, another important property is whether\nthe DM is cold, warm, or even hot [24]. It can have sig-\nnificant effect on the large scale structure (LSS) of our\nUniverse today. The comparison between the galaxy sur-\nvey and the theoretical N-body simulation shows strong\npreference of the cold DM (CDM) [25–28]. Such conclu-\nsion is sometimes strengthened to a claim that DM has\nto be cold. Nevertheless, this is based on the assumption\nthat there is just one DM type. If the DM sector has\nmultiple components, it is perfectly fine to have CDM as\nthe major component with some warm DM (WDM) as a\nminor contribution. Especially, a mixture of CDM and\nWDM can help solving the small scale problem [29, 30].\nThe small-scale effect of WDM can be probed by\nLyman-α[31–33], Milk Way satellite galaxies [34], weak\nlensing [35], strong lensing [36–38], galaxy UV luminosity\nfunction [39–41], and stellar streams [42, 43]. If DM is a\nfermion, it should also be subject to the fermion degen-\nerate gas (Tremaine-Gunn) constraints at the galaxy [44]\nand cosmological [45] levels. These observations require\nthe WDM massm WDM ≳O(1) keV. Therefore, the light\nWDM with mass below keV can contribute only a frac-\ntion of the total DM. The mixed DM scenario with both\nCDM and WDM, has been widely explored [29, 30, 46–62]\nwith various models [63–67]. The current Lyman-αgives\na constraint on the WDM fractionF WDM <O(0.1) for\nthe light DM massm WDM <100 eV [68]. If the WDM\nmass belowm WDM <O(1) eV, it remains nearly rela-\ntivistic around recombination and consequently it will\nalso be subject to the constraint on the effective degree\nof freedom (∆Neff) at the cosmic microwave background\n(CMB) [69]. The light species has also been named as\nhot DM such as [46, 70–89], before the neutrino oscilla-\ntion was established in 1998.\nIn this letter, we explore the possibility of using the\ncosmic gravitational focusing (CGF) to probe the minor\nlight DM component. Similar as the cosmic neutrinos\n[90–95], a light DMXcan also develop a relative bulk\nvelocityv Xc ≡v X −v c with respect to the major CDM\n(c). Then the light DM fluid can be focused when passing\nby the CDM halo and develop a density dipole that can\nbe traced and reconstructed through the cross correla-\ntion between galaxies of different types [90, 94]. Being a\npurely gravitational effect, the CGF effect can serve as a\nmodel-independent method for for probing the light DM.\narXiv:2509.21213v1  [hep-ph]  25 Sep 20252\nCosmic Gravitational Focusing and Rough Sen-\nsitivity Estimation– As studied earlier, the CGF\nwould lead to higher density in the downstream of a\nlight particle fluid such as the cosmic neutrinos [90, 92,\n94, 95]. After substracting the average density, the re-\nmaining overdensityδ(x) mainly behaves like a dipole,\nδ(x) =−δ(−x). With Fourier transformation, ˜δ(k)≡R\nδ(x)e−ik·xd3x, such density dipole becomes an imag-\ninary contribution, ˜δ∗(k) =− ˜δ(k), in the wave-number\n(k) space [96]. Then, the total matter overdensity ˜δm\ncontains the major CDM and the minor light DM contri-\nbutions as real and imaginary parts, ˜δm →(1 +i ˜ϕX)˜δm,\nrespectively. Below the free-streaming scalek −1\nfs of the\nlight DMX,|k| −1 < k−1\nfs , the imaginary phase ˜ϕX for a\nthermal relic [94] is,\n˜ϕX ≡ Ga2\n|k|2 (vXc · ˆk)\n\u0000\nm4\nXf0 + 3m2\nXT2\nAf1 + 2T4\nAf2\n\u0001\n,(1)\nwhere ˆkis the unit vector of the wave numberk. In\naddition,G,a, andT A are the Newton constant, scale\nfactor, and spectrum parameter that controls the light\nDM momentum distribution, respectively. Note that the\nspectrum parameterT A redshifts in the same way as tem-\nperature,T A(a) =T A0/awhereT A0 is the value today,\nwhich would be further discussed in Eq. (2). The coeffi-\ncientsf n(yi)≡g X\nR∞\nyi\ndyy2nd fX(y)/dyare obtained from\nthe integration of the phase space distributionfX(p) with\ny≡ |p|/TA and the lower limity i ≡m X|vXc · ˆk|/TA [94].\nWith the light DMXbeing non-relativistic (m X ≫2.7 K\n∼10 −4 eV) today, the first term dominates them 4\nX de-\npendence. So the CGF effect becomes stronger for a\nheavier DMX.\nAs elaborated in previous studies [90, 92, 94, 95], the\ncosmic relic neutrino with sub-eV mass can already have\nsizable effect. Comparing with the existing LSS and\nCMB constraints [94, 95], the CGF effect can give at\nleast similar sensitivity on the neutrino mass. While the\ncosmic relic neutrinos contribute 0.3% of the total energy\nof our Universe today, the CGF constraint on the light\nDM fractionF X of the total DM density should reach\n0.3%/27%≈1% if the light DM has roughly the same\nmass as neutrinos. Not to say the light DM can have a\nmuch larger mass. Withm 4\nX dependence in Eq. (1), the\nsensitivity can significantly enhance for eV mass to easily\nexceed the existing constraints.\nFreeze-in DM with Modified Mass Scaling Be-\nhavior– The thermally produced light DM with a mass\nbelow 1 MeV is almost excluded by the big-bang nucle-\nosynthesis, since it would contribute too much ∆Neff [97–\n100]. Hence, the light DM is mostly generated from the\nfreeze-in mechanism [101–103], such as the two-body de-\ncay [104–106], or two-to-two processes [107]. A typical\nphase space distribution of such light DMX[104–108] is\nfX(p)≈C X\ne−|p|/TA(a)\np\n|p|/TA(a)\n,(2)\nwherepis the DMXmomentum, andT A(a)≡T A0/ais\na spectrum parameter inherited from the freeze-in pro-\ncess. We takeT A0 = 10 −4 eV as a characteristic value\ntoday. The normalization coefficientC X [104–108] can\nbe parameterized by its current energy density,\nρX0 ≡g XmX\nZ d3p0\n(2π)3 fX0(p0) = 3gXCX\n8π3/2 mXT3\nA0,(3)\nwhereg X is the number of degree of freedom for the light\nDMX. The subscript 0 is for quantities nowadays.\nWith the light DM phase space distributionf X(p) in\nEq. (2), those coefficientsf n in Eq.

Withm X ≫T A0, the first term of Eq. (1) and hence\nf0 dominate. Using the resultf 0 =−g XCXe−yi/2√yi,\nand replacingg XCX with the current DM energy density\nρX0 in Eq. (3), the imaginary phase ˜ϕX for a freeze-in\nlight DM becomes,\n˜ϕX ≈ −4π3/2\n3\nGa2\n|k|2 (vXc · ˆk)ρX0\n\u0012mX\nTA0\n\u00133 e−yi\n√yi\n.(4)\nIf the DMXis very cold, it is expected to fully follow the\nCDM evolution. In this case, there is no relative velocity,\nand no CGF effect at all. Mathematically, this feature\nmanifests in the last term of Eq. (4)e−⟨yi⟩/√yi →0 since\n⟨yi⟩=m X⟨|vXc · ˆk|⟩/TA ≫1 withm X ≫T A0.\nWith the freeze-in phase space distributionf X(p), the\nmass dependence of ˜ϕX is different from the previousm4\nX\nin Eq. (1). This occurs because the current DM density\nρX0 ∝m X has absorbed one power ofm X. Addition-\nally, bothy i and the relative velocityv Xc depend on\nthe light DM massm X. Puttingy i =m X|vXc · ˆk|/TA\nback into Eq. (4), we obtain the mass scaling behavior\n˜ϕX ∝ |vXc|1/2m5/2\nX instead of the original|v Xc|m4\nX.\nConsidering the fact that the relative velocity roughly\nscales inversely with mass,v Xc ∝1/m X, the mass de-\npendence reduces from the original ˜ϕX ∝m 3\nX tom 2\nX\nnow. Since a neutrino mass sum Pmν ≈0.1 eV cor-\nresponds to the relative size of cosmic neutrinos to the\nCDM asF ν ≡Ω ν/ΩCDM ≈10 −2(Pmν/0.1 eV) where\nΩν and Ω CDM are the neutrino and CDM energy den-\nsity fractions of our Universe today, a light DM mass\nmX = 1 eV is expected to receive a constraint roughly\naroundF X ≡Ω X/(ΩCDM + ΩX)≈Ω X/ΩCDM ≲10 −4.\nFree-Streaming and Clustering Limits– Note\nthat Eq. (4) is valid below the free-streaming scale,k−1\nfs ≡3\n2π\np\n2/3⟨|pX|⟩/mXH0 ≈0.384(10 eV/m X) Mpc/h[109]\nwith the average⟨|p X|/TA⟩= 2.5 from the phase space\ndistribution in Eq. (2). However, the free-streaming scale\nof a freeze-in DM withO(10) eV mass is much smaller\nthan 1 Mpc/hwhich is the typical scale of the observed\nmatter power spectrum [110]. So we need to go beyond\nthe solution Eq. (4) for the free-streaming limit.\nFrom the cosmic linear response theory, we can solve\nthe DM overdensity in the rest frame of CDM [111],\n˜δX =i m2\nXa2\nρX0\nZ d3p\n(2π)3 k· ∇pfX,CDM(p) (5)\n×\nZ s\nsi\nds′a2(s′)˜Ψ(s′) exp\n\u0014\n−iap·k\nmX\n(s−s ′)\n\u0015\n,\nwhere ˜Ψ ands≡\nR\ndt/a2 are the gravitational potential\nand superconformal time. In addition, the momentump\nis defined at the superconformal timess. The phase space\ndistributionf X,CDM(p) for the light DMXis defined in\nthe rest frame of CDM and is related to its counterpart\nEq. (2) in the light DM rest frame itself,f X,CDM(p)≡\nfX(p−m XvXc). This can be achieved by changing the\nintegration variablepasp+m XvXc which leads to an\nextra phase factore −iavXc·k(s−s′),\n˜δX =i m2\nXa2\nρX0\nZ d3p\n(2π)3 k· ∇pfX(p)\nZ s\nsi\nds′a2(s′)˜Ψ(s′)\n×exp\n\u0014\n−iap·k\nmX\n(s−s ′)\n\u0015\ne−iavXc·k(s−s′).(6)\nIn the clustering limit,|k| −1 ≫k −1\nfs [111], we\ncan expand the first phase factor to the linear order\nexp [−iap·k(s−s ′)/mX]≈1−iap·k(s−s ′)/mX. SinceR\nk· ∇pfX(p)d 3p= 0 due to spherical symmetry, only\nthe second imaginary term survives. Additionally, with\nthe small relative velocity|v Xc|<10 −3, we can expand\nthe second phase factor of Eq. (6) also to the linear or-\nder,e −iavXc·k(s−s′) ≈1−iav Xc ·k(s−s ′). Their prod-\nuct contains four terms. Besides the unit term, only the\nproduct of the two imaginary linear terms would give a\nreal contribution,−a 2(p·k)(v Xc ·k)(s−s ′)2/mX, that\ncan contribute an imaginary term to ˜δX,\nIm ˜δX =−4πGa\nZ s\nsi\nds′a4(s′)ρm˜δm(vXc ·k)(s−s ′)2.(7)\nWith integration by part, one may prove thatR d3p\n(2π)3\np·k\nmX\nk· ∇pfX(p) =−|k| 2ρX/m2\nX. The result-\ning|k| 2 can be used to replace the gravitational poten-\ntial,|k| 2 ˜Ψ(s′) =−4πGa 2(s′)ρm(s′)˜δm(s′), with the total\nmatter densityρ m and overdensity ˜δm.\nBelow we will mainly use the bright galaxy sample\n(BGS) category at redshiftz <0.5 where the rela-\ntive velocity does not evolve with time [90, 91]. So\nwe can take the velocityv Xc outside the integral. In\naddition, the matter overdensity ˜δm follows the linear\ngrowth rateD + =a, and the matter densityρ m ∝\na−3. Consequently, it is equivalent to replace the term\na2(s′)ρm(s′)˜δm(s′) inside the integration of Eq. (7) by\na2(s)ρm(s)˜δm(s) that can be removed from the integra-\ntion. The imaginary part of the total matter density ˜δm\ncan be parameterized as a phase ˜ϕX,\n˜ϕX =−4πGρ X0(vXc ·k)\nZ s\nsi\nds′a2(s′)(s−s ′)2,(8)\nwhereρ X0 =ρ Xa3 is the current light DM energy den-\nsity. In the final step, we have implemented the relation\nIm ˜δX ≈(ρ X/ρm)Im ˜δm forρ X ≪ρ m.\nComparing with Eq. (4) that is obtained in the free-\nstreaming limit, the clustering limit in Eq. (8) has quite\ndifferent features. Especially, the CGF has no explicit\nmass dependence but implicitly included in the relative\nvelocityv Xc ·k∝1/m 2\nX. The projected sensitivity of\nCGF on the light DM fractionF X will deteriorate for a\nmuch larger mass,m X ≫ O(1) eV, with 1/m2\nX depen-\ndence.\nIn between, we can bridge Eq. (4) and Eq. (8),\n˜ϕX ≡ −4πGFXρDM0(vXc ·k)g(|k|),(9)\nwith an interpolation functiong(|k|), in the similar ways\nas the one for the real part [111]. For convenience, we\nparameterize the energy densityF X ≡ρ X0/ρDM0 as frac-\ntion of the current total DM energy densityρ DM0 con-\ntained in dark matterX. One choice ofg(|k|) is,\ng(|k|)≡A k3\nfs\n(|k|+k fs)3 + (B−A) k4\nfs\n(|k|2 +k fs)4 ,(10)\nsuch thatg(|k|) =A k 3\nfs/|k|3 orBand Eq. (9) reduces\nto the free-streaming (|k| −1 ≪k −1\nfs ) or the clustering\n(|k|−1 ≫k −1\nfs ) limit solution in Eq. (4) or Eq. (8), respec-\ntively.

Fortunately, galax-\nies formation is influenced by the gravitational potential\nof the total matter including bothXand CDM. It is\npossible to use the galaxy distribution to reconstruct the\nmatter density distribution. More specifically, the char-\nacteristic dipole density induced by the CGF effect can be\nreconstructed from the galaxy cross correlation [90, 94].\nThe galaxy number overdensity˜δgα =b α˜δm+ibX ˜ϕX ˜δm\nis a linear combination of the CDM ( ˜δm) and the light\nDM ( ˜ϕX ˜δm) overdensities.

For illustration, we take the phase space dis-\ntribution in Eq. (2) of a typical freeze-in DM with the current\nspectrum parameterT A0 = 10−4 eV around the Universe tem-\nperature today. For comparison, the existing Lyman-α(green\ndashed) CMB ∆Neff (blue dash-dotted) and 21 cm (black dot-\nted) constraints are also shown together.\nfor the CDM andb X is for the light DMX. Following\nthe usual treatment, we take the sameb X = 1 as cosmic\nneutrinos [112].\nWe define the observable signal as the imaginary part\nof the galaxy cross correlationS ≡Im⟨ ˜δgα ˜δgβ⟩and, and\nnoise as its varianceN ≡\np\n⟨S⟩2 − ⟨S⟩2 [94].

(4), and the growth rate\nf≡dlnD +/dlna≈Ω m(z)0.55 where Ωm(z) is the time-\ndependent matter fraction. The ensemble averages⟨ ˙˜ϕ2\nX⟩,\n⟨˜ϕ2\nX⟩, and⟨ ˜ϕX\n˙˜ϕX⟩can be directly derived from Eq. (9)-\nEq. (11b), and are functions of the light DM fractionF X,\nits massm X, and the spectrum parameterT A, with more\ndetails in the supplementary materials. In the following,\nwe implement our calculation by using the CLASS code\n[113, 114].\nUsing the DESI catalogs [94] for the BGS and faint\ngalaxies [115], the projected sensitivity on the light DM\nfractionF X as function of its massm X is plotted as the\nred solid line in Fig. 1. Form X <1 eV where the ob-\nservable scale is below the free-streaming scale, the so-\nlution Eq. (4) works well. As already analyzed above,\nthe projected sensitivity becomes stronger for a heavier\nmass withm 2\nX scaling behavior. On the other hand, for\nmX >10 eV where the observable scale is much larger\nthan its free-streaming scalek −1\nfs ≲0.384 Mpc/h, the so-\nlution follows Eq. (9) with a coefficientg(|k|) =Bin\nEq. (11b). With 1/m 2\nX mass dependence, the light DM\nfractionF X receives weaker constraint for heavier mass.\nSo the intermediate region 1 eV< m X <10 eV exhibits\nthe strongest constraint,F X <10 −3. The overall fea-\ntures of the projected sensitivity can be readily under-\nstood from the mass scaling behaviors.\nOur projected sensitivity from CGF in Fig. 1 comes\nfrom a conservative estimation without considering the\ncosmic neutrinos. Especially, for the left partm X ≲\n0.1 eV where the neutrino mass sum starts to become\ncomparable withm X, the cosmic neutrinos can also con-\ntribute to the dipole distribution [94, 95]. By substract-\ning the the cosmic neutrino contribution, the constraints\non the light DMXis expected to become stronger than\nthe red solid line in Fig. 1. For largerm X ≫0.1 eV, the\nneutrino contribution can be safely ignored.\nFor comparison, we also show the Lyman-α(green\ndashed) and ∆N eff (blue dash-dotted) constraints in\nFig. 1. Since the light DMXhas a higher velocity\nthan the major CDM, it suppresses the structure for-\nmation below its free-streaming scale. Such effect can be\nprobed by the Lyman-αobservations that is sensitive to\nscales 0.5h/Mpc<|k|<20h/Mpc [116]. This suppres-\nsion effect can be parameterized by a transfer function\nT(|k|), ˜δm =T(|k|) ˜δc, where ˜δc is the CDM overden-\nsity. Using a fitting function forT(|k|) from N-body\nsimulations [30] and adopting a conservative constraint\nT 2(|k|<20h/Mpc)≥0.7 [45] taken from Fig.8 of [116],\nwe plot the resulting Lyman-αconstraint as the green\ndashed line in Fig. 1. Across almost the whole mass\nregion in Fig. 1, the Lyman-αconstraint is almost flat\nFX <O(0.1) [68]. This is because the light DM sup-\npresses the power spectrum with a fraction 8F X relative\nthe original power spectrum [117], which is blind to the\nlight DM massm X.\nFor mass below 0.1 eV, the light DMXremains rela-\ntivistic during the recombination. This extra radiation\nenergy density can affect the CMB through the ISW (In-\ntegrated Sachs–Wolfe) effect [69], which is usually pa-\nrameterized as ∆N eff in unit of the effective number of\nneutrino species. We plot the constraint for ∆N eff ≲0.3\n[118, 119], as the blue dash-dotted line in Fig. 1. This\nCMB sensitivity decreases with the light DM massm X\nvery quickly.\nThe CGF constraint is stronger than the existing\nLyman-αand ∆N eff constraints for 0.1 eV< m X <\n100 eV. Notably, the CGF sensitivity can be two or-\nders stronger in the middle region 1 eV< m X <10 eV.5\nEven the forecasted sensitivity for the future 21-cm ob-\nservation can reach onlyF X ≲10 −2 (shown as the black\ndotted line in Fig. 1) [52].\nConclusion and Discussions– Although the large\nscale structure of our Universe prefers the cold DM, a\nlight species can still exist as minor component so long as\nits energy fraction is small enough. However, this leads\nto an imaginable difficulty of probing such minor light\nDM component.\nFortunately, if the minor light DM and the major cold\nDM have quite different masses, they would develop rel-\native bulk velocity. Consequently, the light DM fluid\nwould flow by the cold DM halos and the gravitational\nattraction between them would lead to the cosmic grav-\nitational effect in the same way as the cosmic neutrino\nfluid. However, the light DM with larger mass would have\nmuch stronger effect than its neutrino counterparts. This\nmakes the CGF an ideal tool for probing the light DM.\nWe provide analytical understanding of the sensitiv-\nity scaling behaviors with the light DM massm X in\nboth the free-streaming (m X ≲1 eV) and clustering\n(mX ≳10 eV) limits. Our study shows that for the light\nDM mass 1 eV< m X <10 eV, the projected CGF sen-\nsitivity with the DESI observation can reachF X ≲10 −3\nwhich stronger than the existing Lyman-αand CMB\n∆Neff constraints by two orders. With the upcoming\ngalaxy surveys, such as the spectroscopic survey DESI\n[115, 120] as well as the photometric surveys like LSST\n[121], WFIRST [122], Euclid [123], and CSST [124–126],\nwe expect the CGF effect to receive emerging firm data.\nAcknowledgements\nThe authors are supported by the National Natu-\nral Science Foundation of China (12425506, 12375101,\n12090060 and 12090064) and the SJTU Double First\nClass start-up fund (WF220442604).

(12) contains both ˜ϕX and its time derivative ˙˜ϕX\nwhich in turn can be expressed as functions of the relative velocity variance (dispersion) as well as the interpolation\ncoefficientsAandB, we will first explore the velocity dispersions in Sec. A and then the interpolation coefficients in\nSec. B. More tedious derivations can be found in Sec. C.\nA. Relative Velocity\nThe average relative velocityv Xc between the light DMXand the major CDM component can be estimated as its\ndispersion (similar as the cosmic neutrino case [90, 94]),\n⟨v2\nXc⟩ ≡\nZ d|k|\n|k| ∆2\nζ(k)|TθXc |2\n|k|2\n\f\f\ffW(|k|R)\n\f\f\f\n2\n,(S1)\nwhere ∆ζ, fW(|k|R),T θXc are the dimensionless primordial power spectrum, the window function filter with scaleR,\nand the transfer function of the relative velocity, respectively. We choose the filter scale atR= 5 Mpc/h [94] in our\ncalculation. The transfer functionT θXc ≡( ˜θX − ˜θc)/ζ(k) can be directly obtained from the CLASS code [113, 114]\nsimulation.\nIn the CLASS code [113, 114], we specify the light DM massm X and energy fraction Ω X ≡ρ X0/ρc, whereρ X0\nis the light DM density today andρ c is the critical density, while fixing the total DM energy fraction Ω DMh2 =\n(ΩCDM + ΩX)h2 = 0.12 according to the Planck 2018 data [119]. By varying the light DM massm X and its fraction\nFX ≡Ω X/ΩDM relative to the total DM energy fraction Ω DM, we illustrate the velocity dispersion\np\n⟨v2\nXc⟩and its\ntime evolution in the left and right panels of Fig. S1, respectively.

However, as scale increases, the relative\nvelocity is expected to decrease because the velocity field is not coherent on large scales, which is verified by N-body\nsimulations [91].

For redshiftz≳10 when the dark energy has\nnot started to dominate, the behavior and history of our\nUniverse is mainly determined by radiation and matter.\nOf the later, more than 80% are contributed by DM while\nthe remaining by the ordinary matter. To be exact, DM\nis more than 5 times of the ordinary matter. It is then\na fair question to ask whether the DM has just a single\ntype or actually possesses multiple components. Since\nthe ordinary matter world is already a combination of\nvarious isotopes that are formed by at least three building\nblocks (proton, neutron, and electron), it is natural for\nthe DM sector to also have several species.\nThe particle physics provides various DM candidates\n[4, 5] that are not just conceptually neat with unified\nquantum field theory description in the same way as the\nordinary matter but also very simple with typically just\nmass and coupling strength as the only parameters to\nexplain the observed DM phenomena from both astron-\nomy and cosmology. Of them, the particular interest-\ning ones include the Weakly Interacting Massive Parti-\ncles (WIMP) [6–10] that participate the weak gauge in-\nteractions with mass typically at GeV∼TeV, the sterile\nneutrino at keV scale [11–19] suggested by the observed\nanomalies in neutrino oscillation experiments and astro-\nphysical observations, and the axion [20–22] motivated\nby the strong CP problem with even lighter mass. The\nmass spectrum of particle DM candidates spans around\n100 orders from the smallest fuzzy DM at 10−22 eV to the\nastrophysical primordial black holes (PBH) with masses\nof 1050 g (∼10 88 eV) [23]. It is possible for the DM can-\ndidates to have totally different masses.\nBesides mass, another important property is whether\nthe DM is cold, warm, or even hot [24]. It can have sig-\nnificant effect on the large scale structure (LSS) of our\nUniverse today. The comparison between the galaxy sur-\nvey and the theoretical N-body simulation shows strong\npreference of the cold DM (CDM) [25–28]. Such conclu-\nsion is sometimes strengthened to a claim that DM has\nto be cold. Nevertheless, this is based on the assumption\nthat there is just one DM type. If the DM sector has\nmultiple components, it is perfectly fine to have CDM as\nthe major component with some warm DM (WDM) as a\nminor contribution. Especially, a mixture of CDM and\nWDM can help solving the small scale problem [29, 30].\nThe small-scale effect of WDM can be probed by\nLyman-α[31–33], Milk Way satellite galaxies [34], weak\nlensing [35], strong lensing [36–38], galaxy UV luminosity\nfunction [39–41], and stellar streams [42, 43]. If DM is a\nfermion, it should also be subject to the fermion degen-\nerate gas (Tremaine-Gunn) constraints at the galaxy [44]\nand cosmological [45] levels. These observations require\nthe WDM massm WDM ≳O(1) keV. Therefore, the light\nWDM with mass below keV can contribute only a frac-\ntion of the total DM. The mixed DM scenario with both\nCDM and WDM, has been widely explored [29, 30, 46–62]\nwith various models [63–67]. The current Lyman-αgives\na constraint on the WDM fractionF WDM <O(0.1) for\nthe light DM massm WDM <100 eV [68]. If the WDM\nmass belowm WDM <O(1) eV, it remains nearly rela-\ntivistic around recombination and consequently it will\nalso be subject to the constraint on the effective degree\nof freedom (∆Neff) at the cosmic microwave background\n(CMB) [69]. The light species has also been named as\nhot DM such as [46, 70–89], before the neutrino oscilla-\ntion was established in 1998.\nIn this letter, we explore the possibility of using the\ncosmic gravitational focusing (CGF) to probe the minor\nlight DM component. Similar as the cosmic neutrinos\n[90–95], a light DMXcan also develop a relative bulk\nvelocityv Xc ≡v X −v c with respect to the major CDM\n(c). Then the light DM fluid can be focused when passing\nby the CDM halo and develop a density dipole that can\nbe traced and reconstructed through the cross correla-\ntion between galaxies of different types [90, 94]. Being a\npurely gravitational effect, the CGF effect can serve as a\nmodel-independent method for for probing the light DM.\narXiv:2509.21213v1  [hep-ph]  25 Sep 20252\nCosmic Gravitational Focusing and Rough Sen-\nsitivity Estimation– As studied earlier, the CGF\nwould lead to higher density in the downstream of a\nlight particle fluid such as the cosmic neutrinos [90, 92,\n94, 95]. After substracting the average density, the re-\nmaining overdensityδ(x) mainly behaves like a dipole,\nδ(x) =−δ(−x). With Fourier transformation, ˜δ(k)≡R\nδ(x)e−ik·xd3x, such density dipole becomes an imag-\ninary contribution, ˜δ∗(k) =− ˜δ(k), in the wave-number\n(k) space [96]. Then, the total matter overdensity ˜δm\ncontains the major CDM and the minor light DM contri-\nbutions as real and imaginary parts, ˜δm →(1 +i ˜ϕX)˜δm,\nrespectively. Below the free-streaming scalek −1\nfs of the\nlight DMX,|k| −1 < k−1\nfs , the imaginary phase ˜ϕX for a\nthermal relic [94] is,\n˜ϕX ≡ Ga2\n|k|2 (vXc · ˆk)\n\u0000\nm4\nXf0 + 3m2\nXT2\nAf1 + 2T4\nAf2\n\u0001\n,(1)\nwhere ˆkis the unit vector of the wave numberk. In\naddition,G,a, andT A are the Newton constant, scale\nfactor, and spectrum parameter that controls the light\nDM momentum distribution, respectively. Note that the\nspectrum parameterT A redshifts in the same way as tem-\nperature,T A(a) =T A0/awhereT A0 is the value today,\nwhich would be further discussed in Eq. (2). The coeffi-\ncientsf n(yi)≡g X\nR∞\nyi\ndyy2nd fX(y)/dyare obtained from\nthe integration of the phase space distributionfX(p) with\ny≡ |p|/TA and the lower limity i ≡m X|vXc · ˆk|/TA [94].\nWith the light DMXbeing non-relativistic (m X ≫2.7 K\n∼10 −4 eV) today, the first term dominates them 4\nX de-\npendence. So the CGF effect becomes stronger for a\nheavier DMX.\nAs elaborated in previous studies [90, 92, 94, 95], the\ncosmic relic neutrino with sub-eV mass can already have\nsizable effect. Comparing with the existing LSS and\nCMB constraints [94, 95], the CGF effect can give at\nleast similar sensitivity on the neutrino mass. While the\ncosmic relic neutrinos contribute 0.3% of the total energy\nof our Universe today, the CGF constraint on the light\nDM fractionF X of the total DM density should reach\n0.3%/27%≈1% if the light DM has roughly the same\nmass as neutrinos. Not to say the light DM can have a\nmuch larger mass. Withm 4\nX dependence in Eq. (1), the\nsensitivity can significantly enhance for eV mass to easily\nexceed the existing constraints.\nFreeze-in DM with Modified Mass Scaling Be-\nhavior– The thermally produced light DM with a mass\nbelow 1 MeV is almost excluded by the big-bang nucle-\nosynthesis, since it would contribute too much ∆Neff [97–\n100]. Hence, the light DM is mostly generated from the\nfreeze-in mechanism [101–103], such as the two-body de-\ncay [104–106], or two-to-two processes [107]. A typical\nphase space distribution of such light DMX[104–108] is\nfX(p)≈C X\ne−|p|/TA(a)\np\n|p|/TA(a)\n,(2)\nwherepis the DMXmomentum, andT A(a)≡T A0/ais\na spectrum parameter inherited from the freeze-in pro-\ncess. We takeT A0 = 10 −4 eV as a characteristic value\ntoday. The normalization coefficientC X [104–108] can\nbe parameterized by its current energy density,\nρX0 ≡g XmX\nZ d3p0\n(2π)3 fX0(p0) = 3gXCX\n8π3/2 mXT3\nA0,(3)\nwhereg X is the number of degree of freedom for the light\nDMX. The subscript 0 is for quantities nowadays.\nWith the light DM phase space distributionf X(p) in\nEq. (2), those coefficientsf n in Eq. (1) can be integrated\nanalytically,\nfn =−g XCX\n\u00141\n2Γ\n\u0012\n−1\n2 + 2n, yi\n\u0013\n+ Γ\n\u00121\n2 + 2n, yi\n\u0013\u0015\n,\nwhere the Γ(x, y) is theUpper Incomplete Gamma Func-\ntion. Withm X ≫T A0, the first term of Eq. (1) and hence\nf0 dominate. Using the resultf 0 =−g XCXe−yi/2√yi,\nand replacingg XCX with the current DM energy density\nρX0 in Eq. (3), the imaginary phase ˜ϕX for a freeze-in\nlight DM becomes,\n˜ϕX ≈ −4π3/2\n3\nGa2\n|k|2 (vXc · ˆk)ρX0\n\u0012mX\nTA0\n\u00133 e−yi\n√yi\n.(4)\nIf the DMXis very cold, it is expected to fully follow the\nCDM evolution. In this case, there is no relative velocity,\nand no CGF effect at all. Mathematically, this feature\nmanifests in the last term of Eq. (4)e−⟨yi⟩/√yi →0 since\n⟨yi⟩=m X⟨|vXc · ˆk|⟩/TA ≫1 withm X ≫T A0.\nWith the freeze-in phase space distributionf X(p), the\nmass dependence of ˜ϕX is different from the previousm4\nX\nin Eq. (1). This occurs because the current DM density\nρX0 ∝m X has absorbed one power ofm X. Addition-\nally, bothy i and the relative velocityv Xc depend on\nthe light DM massm X. Puttingy i =m X|vXc · ˆk|/TA\nback into Eq. (4), we obtain the mass scaling behavior\n˜ϕX ∝ |vXc|1/2m5/2\nX instead of the original|v Xc|m4\nX.\nConsidering the fact that the relative velocity roughly\nscales inversely with mass,v Xc ∝1/m X, the mass de-\npendence reduces from the original ˜ϕX ∝m 3\nX tom 2\nX\nnow. Since a neutrino mass sum Pmν ≈0.1 eV cor-\nresponds to the relative size of cosmic neutrinos to the\nCDM asF ν ≡Ω ν/ΩCDM ≈10 −2(Pmν/0.1 eV) where\nΩν and Ω CDM are the neutrino and CDM energy den-\nsity fractions of our Universe today, a light DM mass\nmX = 1 eV is expected to receive a constraint roughly\naroundF X ≡Ω X/(ΩCDM + ΩX)≈Ω X/ΩCDM ≲10 −4.\nFree-Streaming and Clustering Limits– Note\nthat Eq. (4) is valid below the free-streaming scale,k−1\nfs ≡3\n2π\np\n2/3⟨|pX|⟩/mXH0 ≈0.384(10 eV/m X) Mpc/h[109]\nwith the average⟨|p X|/TA⟩= 2.5 from the phase space\ndistribution in Eq. (2). However, the free-streaming scale\nof a freeze-in DM withO(10) eV mass is much smaller\nthan 1 Mpc/hwhich is the typical scale of the observed\nmatter power spectrum [110]. So we need to go beyond\nthe solution Eq. (4) for the free-streaming limit.\nFrom the cosmic linear response theory, we can solve\nthe DM overdensity in the rest frame of CDM [111],\n˜δX =i m2\nXa2\nρX0\nZ d3p\n(2π)3 k· ∇pfX,CDM(p) (5)\n×\nZ s\nsi\nds′a2(s′)˜Ψ(s′) exp\n\u0014\n−iap·k\nmX\n(s−s ′)\n\u0015\n,\nwhere ˜Ψ ands≡\nR\ndt/a2 are the gravitational potential\nand superconformal time. In addition, the momentump\nis defined at the superconformal timess. The phase space\ndistributionf X,CDM(p) for the light DMXis defined in\nthe rest frame of CDM and is related to its counterpart\nEq. (2) in the light DM rest frame itself,f X,CDM(p)≡\nfX(p−m XvXc). This can be achieved by changing the\nintegration variablepasp+m XvXc which leads to an\nextra phase factore −iavXc·k(s−s′),\n˜δX =i m2\nXa2\nρX0\nZ d3p\n(2π)3 k· ∇pfX(p)\nZ s\nsi\nds′a2(s′)˜Ψ(s′)\n×exp\n\u0014\n−iap·k\nmX\n(s−s ′)\n\u0015\ne−iavXc·k(s−s′).(6)\nIn the clustering limit,|k| −1 ≫k −1\nfs [111], we\ncan expand the first phase factor to the linear order\nexp [−iap·k(s−s ′)/mX]≈1−iap·k(s−s ′)/mX. SinceR\nk· ∇pfX(p)d 3p= 0 due to spherical symmetry, only\nthe second imaginary term survives. Additionally, with\nthe small relative velocity|v Xc|<10 −3, we can expand\nthe second phase factor of Eq. (6) also to the linear or-\nder,e −iavXc·k(s−s′) ≈1−iav Xc ·k(s−s ′). Their prod-\nuct contains four terms. Besides the unit term, only the\nproduct of the two imaginary linear terms would give a\nreal contribution,−a 2(p·k)(v Xc ·k)(s−s ′)2/mX, that\ncan contribute an imaginary term to ˜δX,\nIm ˜δX =−4πGa\nZ s\nsi\nds′a4(s′)ρm˜δm(vXc ·k)(s−s ′)2.(7)\nWith integration by part, one may prove thatR d3p\n(2π)3\np·k\nmX\nk· ∇pfX(p) =−|k| 2ρX/m2\nX. The result-\ning|k| 2 can be used to replace the gravitational poten-\ntial,|k| 2 ˜Ψ(s′) =−4πGa 2(s′)ρm(s′)˜δm(s′), with the total\nmatter densityρ m and overdensity ˜δm.\nBelow we will mainly use the bright galaxy sample\n(BGS) category at redshiftz <0.5 where the rela-\ntive velocity does not evolve with time [90, 91]. So\nwe can take the velocityv Xc outside the integral. In\naddition, the matter overdensity ˜δm follows the linear\ngrowth rateD + =a, and the matter densityρ m ∝\na−3. Consequently, it is equivalent to replace the term\na2(s′)ρm(s′)˜δm(s′) inside the integration of Eq. (7) by\na2(s)ρm(s)˜δm(s) that can be removed from the integra-\ntion. The imaginary part of the total matter density ˜δm\ncan be parameterized as a phase ˜ϕX,\n˜ϕX =−4πGρ X0(vXc ·k)\nZ s\nsi\nds′a2(s′)(s−s ′)2,(8)\nwhereρ X0 =ρ Xa3 is the current light DM energy den-\nsity. In the final step, we have implemented the relation\nIm ˜δX ≈(ρ X/ρm)Im ˜δm forρ X ≪ρ m.\nComparing with Eq. (4) that is obtained in the free-\nstreaming limit, the clustering limit in Eq. (8) has quite\ndifferent features. Especially, the CGF has no explicit\nmass dependence but implicitly included in the relative\nvelocityv Xc ·k∝1/m 2\nX. The projected sensitivity of\nCGF on the light DM fractionF X will deteriorate for a\nmuch larger mass,m X ≫ O(1) eV, with 1/m2\nX depen-\ndence.\nIn between, we can bridge Eq. (4) and Eq. (8),\n˜ϕX ≡ −4πGFXρDM0(vXc ·k)g(|k|),(9)\nwith an interpolation functiong(|k|), in the similar ways\nas the one for the real part [111]. For convenience, we\nparameterize the energy densityF X ≡ρ X0/ρDM0 as frac-\ntion of the current total DM energy densityρ DM0 con-\ntained in dark matterX. One choice ofg(|k|) is,\ng(|k|)≡A k3\nfs\n(|k|+k fs)3 + (B−A) k4\nfs\n(|k|2 +k fs)4 ,(10)\nsuch thatg(|k|) =A k 3\nfs/|k|3 orBand Eq. (9) reduces\nto the free-streaming (|k| −1 ≪k −1\nfs ) or the clustering\n(|k|−1 ≫k −1\nfs ) limit solution in Eq. (4) or Eq. (8), respec-\ntively. The corresponding coefficientA(B) is given by\nA≡\n√π\n3\na2\nk3\nfs\n\u0012mX\nTA0\n\u00133 e−yi\n√yi\n,(11a)\nB≡\nZ s\nsi\nds′a2(s′)(s−s ′)2.(11b)\nGalaxy Cross Correlation and Projected Sensi-\ntivity– Neither the light DMXnor the major CDM\ncomponent can be directly observed. Fortunately, galax-\nies formation is influenced by the gravitational potential\nof the total matter including bothXand CDM. It is\npossible to use the galaxy distribution to reconstruct the\nmatter density distribution. More specifically, the char-\nacteristic dipole density induced by the CGF effect can be\nreconstructed from the galaxy cross correlation [90, 94].\nThe galaxy number overdensity˜δgα =b α˜δm+ibX ˜ϕX ˜δm\nis a linear combination of the CDM ( ˜δm) and the light\nDM ( ˜ϕX ˜δm) overdensities.

For illustration, we take the phase space dis-\ntribution in Eq. (2) of a typical freeze-in DM with the current\nspectrum parameterT A0 = 10−4 eV around the Universe tem-\nperature today. For comparison, the existing Lyman-α(green\ndashed) CMB ∆Neff (blue dash-dotted) and 21 cm (black dot-\nted) constraints are also shown together.\nfor the CDM andb X is for the light DMX. Following\nthe usual treatment, we take the sameb X = 1 as cosmic\nneutrinos [112].\nWe define the observable signal as the imaginary part\nof the galaxy cross correlationS ≡Im⟨ ˜δgα ˜δgβ⟩and, and\nnoise as its varianceN ≡\np\n⟨S⟩2 − ⟨S⟩2 [94].

(4), and the growth rate\nf≡dlnD +/dlna≈Ω m(z)0.55 where Ωm(z) is the time-\ndependent matter fraction. The ensemble averages⟨ ˙˜ϕ2\nX⟩,\n⟨˜ϕ2\nX⟩, and⟨ ˜ϕX\n˙˜ϕX⟩can be directly derived from Eq. (9)-\nEq. (11b), and are functions of the light DM fractionF X,\nits massm X, and the spectrum parameterT A, with more\ndetails in the supplementary materials. In the following,\nwe implement our calculation by using the CLASS code\n[113, 114].\nUsing the DESI catalogs [94] for the BGS and faint\ngalaxies [115], the projected sensitivity on the light DM\nfractionF X as function of its massm X is plotted as the\nred solid line in Fig. 1. Form X <1 eV where the ob-\nservable scale is below the free-streaming scale, the so-\nlution Eq. (4) works well. As already analyzed above,\nthe projected sensitivity becomes stronger for a heavier\nmass withm 2\nX scaling behavior. On the other hand, for\nmX >10 eV where the observable scale is much larger\nthan its free-streaming scalek −1\nfs ≲0.384 Mpc/h, the so-\nlution follows Eq. (9) with a coefficientg(|k|) =Bin\nEq. (11b). With 1/m 2\nX mass dependence, the light DM\nfractionF X receives weaker constraint for heavier mass.\nSo the intermediate region 1 eV< m X <10 eV exhibits\nthe strongest constraint,F X <10 −3. The overall fea-\ntures of the projected sensitivity can be readily under-\nstood from the mass scaling behaviors.\nOur projected sensitivity from CGF in Fig. 1 comes\nfrom a conservative estimation without considering the\ncosmic neutrinos. Especially, for the left partm X ≲\n0.1 eV where the neutrino mass sum starts to become\ncomparable withm X, the cosmic neutrinos can also con-\ntribute to the dipole distribution [94, 95]. By substract-\ning the the cosmic neutrino contribution, the constraints\non the light DMXis expected to become stronger than\nthe red solid line in Fig. 1. For largerm X ≫0.1 eV, the\nneutrino contribution can be safely ignored.\nFor comparison, we also show the Lyman-α(green\ndashed) and ∆N eff (blue dash-dotted) constraints in\nFig. 1. Since the light DMXhas a higher velocity\nthan the major CDM, it suppresses the structure for-\nmation below its free-streaming scale. Such effect can be\nprobed by the Lyman-αobservations that is sensitive to\nscales 0.5h/Mpc<|k|<20h/Mpc [116]. This suppres-\nsion effect can be parameterized by a transfer function\nT(|k|), ˜δm =T(|k|) ˜δc, where ˜δc is the CDM overden-\nsity. Using a fitting function forT(|k|) from N-body\nsimulations [30] and adopting a conservative constraint\nT 2(|k|<20h/Mpc)≥0.7 [45] taken from Fig.8 of [116],\nwe plot the resulting Lyman-αconstraint as the green\ndashed line in Fig. 1. Across almost the whole mass\nregion in Fig. 1, the Lyman-αconstraint is almost flat\nFX <O(0.1) [68]. This is because the light DM sup-\npresses the power spectrum with a fraction 8F X relative\nthe original power spectrum [117], which is blind to the\nlight DM massm X.\nFor mass below 0.1 eV, the light DMXremains rela-\ntivistic during the recombination. This extra radiation\nenergy density can affect the CMB through the ISW (In-\ntegrated Sachs–Wolfe) effect [69], which is usually pa-\nrameterized as ∆N eff in unit of the effective number of\nneutrino species. We plot the constraint for ∆N eff ≲0.3\n[118, 119], as the blue dash-dotted line in Fig. 1. This\nCMB sensitivity decreases with the light DM massm X\nvery quickly.\nThe CGF constraint is stronger than the existing\nLyman-αand ∆N eff constraints for 0.1 eV< m X <\n100 eV. Notably, the CGF sensitivity can be two or-\nders stronger in the middle region 1 eV< m X <10 eV.5\nEven the forecasted sensitivity for the future 21-cm ob-\nservation can reach onlyF X ≲10 −2 (shown as the black\ndotted line in Fig. 1) [52].\nConclusion and Discussions– Although the large\nscale structure of our Universe prefers the cold DM, a\nlight species can still exist as minor component so long as\nits energy fraction is small enough. However, this leads\nto an imaginable difficulty of probing such minor light\nDM component.\nFortunately, if the minor light DM and the major cold\nDM have quite different masses, they would develop rel-\native bulk velocity. Consequently, the light DM fluid\nwould flow by the cold DM halos and the gravitational\nattraction between them would lead to the cosmic grav-\nitational effect in the same way as the cosmic neutrino\nfluid. However, the light DM with larger mass would have\nmuch stronger effect than its neutrino counterparts. This\nmakes the CGF an ideal tool for probing the light DM.\nWe provide analytical understanding of the sensitiv-\nity scaling behaviors with the light DM massm X in\nboth the free-streaming (m X ≲1 eV) and clustering\n(mX ≳10 eV) limits. Our study shows that for the light\nDM mass 1 eV< m X <10 eV, the projected CGF sen-\nsitivity with the DESI observation can reachF X ≲10 −3\nwhich stronger than the existing Lyman-αand CMB\n∆Neff constraints by two orders. With the upcoming\ngalaxy surveys, such as the spectroscopic survey DESI\n[115, 120] as well as the photometric surveys like LSST\n[121], WFIRST [122], Euclid [123], and CSST [124–126],\nwe expect the CGF effect to receive emerging firm data.\nAcknowledgements\nThe authors are supported by the National Natu-\nral Science Foundation of China (12425506, 12375101,\n12090060 and 12090064) and the SJTU Double First\nClass start-up fund (WF220442604).

(12) contains both ˜ϕX and its time derivative ˙˜ϕX\nwhich in turn can be expressed as functions of the relative velocity variance (dispersion) as well as the interpolation\ncoefficientsAandB, we will first explore the velocity dispersions in Sec. A and then the interpolation coefficients in\nSec. B. More tedious derivations can be found in Sec. C.\nA. Relative Velocity\nThe average relative velocityv Xc between the light DMXand the major CDM component can be estimated as its\ndispersion (similar as the cosmic neutrino case [90, 94]),\n⟨v2\nXc⟩ ≡\nZ d|k|\n|k| ∆2\nζ(k)|TθXc |2\n|k|2\n\f\f\ffW(|k|R)\n\f\f\f\n2\n,(S1)\nwhere ∆ζ, fW(|k|R),T θXc are the dimensionless primordial power spectrum, the window function filter with scaleR,\nand the transfer function of the relative velocity, respectively. We choose the filter scale atR= 5 Mpc/h [94] in our\ncalculation. The transfer functionT θXc ≡( ˜θX − ˜θc)/ζ(k) can be directly obtained from the CLASS code [113, 114]\nsimulation.\nIn the CLASS code [113, 114], we specify the light DM massm X and energy fraction Ω X ≡ρ X0/ρc, whereρ X0\nis the light DM density today andρ c is the critical density, while fixing the total DM energy fraction Ω DMh2 =\n(ΩCDM + ΩX)h2 = 0.12 according to the Planck 2018 data [119]. By varying the light DM massm X and its fraction\nFX ≡Ω X/ΩDM relative to the total DM energy fraction Ω DM, we illustrate the velocity dispersion\np\n⟨v2\nXc⟩and its\ntime evolution in the left and right panels of Fig. S1, respectively. Note that the freeze-in phase space distribution is\ntaken from Eq. (2). While the left panel shows that the velocity dispersion\np\n⟨v2\nXc⟩decreases with the light DM mass\nmX, the right panel demonstrates that the relative velocity remains nearly constant with time forz <1.\n10−1 100 101 102\nmX [eV]\n10−5\n10−4\n10−3\n√\n⟨v2\nXc⟩\nTA0 = 10−4 eV\nFX = 10−2\nFX = 10−5\n10−1\n100\n⟨yi⟩ = ⟨|vk|⟩mX/TA0\n10−3 10−2 10−1 1 10\nRedshift (z)\n10−5\n10−4\n10−3\n√\n⟨v2\nXc⟩\nmX = 0.1 eV\nmX = 1 eV\nmX = 10 eV\nmX = 100 eV\nFIG.

(S1) is specifically applicable to small scales. However, as scale increases, the relative\nvelocity is expected to decrease because the velocity field is not coherent on large scales, which is verified by N-body\nsimulations [91]. To account for this decreasing behavior, we incorporate the Θ(|k| − |k′|) function [92, 94] within\nEq.

In most of the mass region, the parameter\n⟨yi⟩=m X⟨|vk|⟩/TA <1 by choosing the smallest scale|k| −1 = 1 Mpc/hin our calculation, as shown in the left panel\nof Fig. S1. So we can approximate the exponential factor ase −yi ≈1.

INTRODUCTION\nVortex, or twisted, electrons are electrons in specific\nquantum states with a definite projection of an orbital\nangular momentum (OAM) along their propagation axis\n[1–3]. Their OAM results in a magnetic moment that can\nsignificantly exceed its spin-originated counterpart. This\nproperty makes vortex electrons promising for numerous\napplications in material science, chemistry, and particle\nphysics [3–5]. However, in particle physics, specifically,\nelectrons are required with energies in the GeV range,\nwhereas the highest energy achieved for a vortex electron\nto date is only about 300 keV [3, 6, 7].\nA straightforward approach to obtaining high-energy\nvortex electrons is to first generate twisted electrons at\nlow energies and then accelerate them. While the curvi-\nlinear sections of accelerators are likely unsuitable since\nthey lack axial symmetry, linear accelerators (linacs) ap-\npear to be appropriate for this purpose. However, a crit-\nical question arises: do these particles preserve their vor-\nticity as they travel through the accelerator’s electromag-\nnetic fields? Specifically, could the small but inevitable\nradiation losses in a linac lead to a significant decrease\nin the particle’s OAM?\nHere we make a very first step towards addressing this\nquestion by employing a semiclassical approach for find-\n∗ george.zmaga@mail.ru\n† georgii.sizykh@metalab.ifmo.ru\n‡ dmitriy.grosman@metalab.ifmo.ru\n§ mengq8@mail2.sysu.edu.cn\n¶ zoulp5@mail.sysu.edu.cn\n∗∗ zhangpm5@mail.sysu.edu.cn\n†† dmitry.karlovets@metalab.ifmo.ru\ning the radiated power and the corresponding loss of an-\ngular momentum. Our method begins with the wave-\nfunction of a vortex electron, from which we derive the\nprobability density and current. Multiplying by the elec-\ntric charge and interpreting these densities as the effec-\ntive distribution of the electric charge and current, we\nthen use them as the source terms on the right-hand side\nof Maxwell’s equations.\nWe model the linac as a region with homogeneous, lon-\ngitudinal electric and magnetic fields. The primary role\nof the electric field is acceleration, and its contribution to\nradiation is negligible. Therefore, our analysis of radia-\ntion focuses exclusively on the effects of the longitudinal\nmagnetic field.\nA vortex electron in free space is most realistically\ndescribed with a free nonstationary Laguerre-Gaussian\n(NSLGf) state [3, 8–14]. Due to its nonstationary dynam-\nics, the electron cannot be described with a stationary\nLandau state upon entering the magnetic field. Instead,\nits motion is accurately characterized with the nonsta-\ntionary counterparts of Landau states: NSLG states in a\nmagnetic field [12, 13, 15–18]. Their distinguishing fea-\nture lies in oscillations of the state’s root-mean-square\n(r.m.s.) radius, resembling the phenomenon of betatron\noscillations. Consequently, even within a magnetic field\ncollinear with its average momentum, the electron’s wave\npacket behaves as a “breathing” charge cloud. From the\nperspective of classical electrodynamics, such an oscil-\nlating charge distribution must radiate, and calculating\nthe characteristics of this radiation is the primary focus\nof this work. We illustrate our results in two experi-\nmentally relevant scenarios — for electron microscopes\nand linacs. Examining both of these, it is shown that the\nlosses of OAM are negligible in the vast majority of cases,\nthus enabling transport and focusing of vortex electrons,\narXiv:2509.21195v1  [quant-ph]  25 Sep 20252\nprotons, or ions in the longitudinal magnetic fields.\nThroughout this paper, we use CGS units and define\nthe electron charge ase <0.\nII. NSLG STATES\nIn this section we briefly review NSLG states (a thor-\nough analysis of them can be found in [12]). These are an\northogonal complete set of nonstationaryexactsolutions\nto the Schr¨ odinger equation,\niℏ∂tψ(r, t) =( ˆp−eA/c) 2\n2m ψ(r, t),(1)\nwhere ˆp=−iℏ∇and the external field vector potential\nA=0in free space and\nA= Hr⊥\n2 ˆeϕ (2)\nin a constant homogeneous longitudinal magnetic field.\nIn free space the transverse dynamics of a spatially lo-\ncalized vortex electron is described with an NSLG f state\n(see Sec. 2.3 in [12]),\nΨn,l(r⊥, t) =N⊥\nr|l|\n⊥\nσ|l|+1(t)L|l|\nn\n\u0012 r2\n⊥\nσ2(t)\n\u0013\n×\nexp\n\u0014\nilϕ−iΦ G(t)− r2\n⊥\n2σ2(t)\n\u0012\n1−i σ2(t)\nλCR(t)\n\u0013\u0015\n,\n(3)\nwhereλ C =ℏ/(mc) is the reduced Compton wavelength,\nn∈ {0,1,2...}andl∈ {0,±1,±2...}are radial and or-\nbital quantum numbers,N ⊥ is the normalization con-\nstant (see Eq. (5) in [12]), and the optical functions —\ndeviationσ(t) =σ f(t), curvature radiusR(t) =R f(t),\nand Gouy phase Φ G(t) = Φ f\nG(t) — are determined by\nEqs. (12) and the first line of Eq. (10) in [12].\nAn important feature of such a state is the r.m.s. ra-\ndius,\nq\n⟨r2\n⊥⟩ − ⟨r⊥⟩2\nf\n=ϱ f(t) =σ f(t)\np\n2n+|l|+ 1.(4)\nHence, when such a vortex electron approaches a solenoid\nfrom free space it spreads, which prevents it from contin-\nuously transitioning into a stationary Landau state [13].\nNonetheless, a continuous state can be constructed by\nconsidering NSLG states within the field instead of Lan-\ndau states. They are solutions to Eq. (1) with the vector\npotential in the symmetric gauge (see Eq. (2)). NSLG\nstates in the magnetic field have the same form (3) as\nin free space albeit with different optical functionsσ(t),\nR(t), and ΦG(t). The r.m.s. radius is still determined by\ngeneral Eq. (4). Its evolution is governed by the devia-\ntion functionσ(t), which is now given by\nσ(t) =σ st\nvuut1 +\ns\n1−\n\u0012σL\nσst\n\u00134\nsin (sωct−ϑ),\nσ2\nst = σ2\n0\n2\n \n1 +\n\u0012σL\nσ0\n\u00134\n+\n\u0012 σ′\n0σ2\nL\ncλCσ0\n\u00132!\n,\nϑ= arcsin 1−(σ 0/σst)2\nq\n1−(σ L/σst)4\n.\n(5)\nHereσ 0 andσ ′\n0 are initial values of the wave packet’s\nwidth deviation and its derivative that are dictated by\nthe state of the incident free-space wave packet;ω c =\neH/(mc) is the cyclotron frequency, and\nσL =\ns\n2ℏc\n|eH| (6)\nis the r.m.s. radius of the Landau state withn=l= 0.\nThe deviation functionσ(t) indicates the wave packet’s\ntransverse size oscillates with the cyclotron frequency.\nThe sign function\ns≡s(σ 0, σ′\n0) =\n\n\n\nsign(σ′\n0), σ′\n0 ̸= 0,\nsign(σL −σ 0), σ′\n0 = 0 andσ 0 ̸=σ L,\n0, σ′\n0 = 0 andσ 0 =σ L;\n(7)\ndetermines whether the wave packet initially expands or\ncontracts. The latter scenario is a very special case when\nthe NSLG state becomes a stationary Landau state. The\nGouy phase ΦG(t) is given by Eq. (29) in [12], whileR(t)\nin Eq. (3) can be derived from the first line of Eq. (10)\nin [12] using the dispersion equations (5).\nThe electron’s OAM is independent of its longitudi-\nnal motion, which is unaffected by the vacuum-solenoid\nboundary crossing. Thus, we choose it to be a simple\nGaussian wave packet with the average longitudinal mo-\nmentump 0 and the “size”σ z (A1) short enough that the\nelectron dynamics remain unchanged when passing the\ntransition region, as detailed in the Supplemental Mate-\nrial of Ref. [13] (reference [29] there). We present the\nlongitudinal wave function in Eq. (A1). We also note\nthatp 0 does not contribute to further results.\nThe wave function (3) with the deviation function (5)\nyields the charge and current densities,\nρ(r, t) =e|Ψ (r, t)|2,\nj(r, t) =eRe\n\u001a\nΨ∗ (r, t)ˆp\nmΨ (r, t)\n\u001b\n− e2\nmc|Ψ (r, t)|2A,\n(8)\nthe exact expressions for which are given in Eq.

As it\npropagates along thez-axis, its wave function oscillates (the “breathing” NSLG mode). This non-stationary charge\ndistribution emits radiation. The field emitted from a source pointrat an earlier timeτis observed at a distant\npointR.\nA UNIFORM EXTERNAL MAGNETIC FIELD\nA. Characteristics of emitted radiation\nFrom a classical electrodynamics perspective, Eqs. (8)\ndescribe a non-uniformly moving charge cloud, which\nmust emit electromagnetic waves.

The\nsetup it schematically depicted in Fig. 1.\nAt this point, we employ the standard far-field ap-\nproximation, assuming that the characteristic size of the\nradiating system is much smaller than the distance to\nthe observation point. However, in addition to the time-\nderivative term, we also take into account the one aris-\ning from the denominator expansion. This term provides\nthe leading-order contribution to the angular momentum\nof radiation, althoughit is irrelevant for the radiation\npower.\nAccordingly, we expand integrands in Eq. (9) into a\nseries:\nf(r, t′)\n|R−r| ≈ f(r, τ)\nR + r·ˆeR ∂τ f(r, τ)\nRc + r·ˆeR f(r, τ)\nR2 ,\n(10)\nwherefis a charge density or the component of a current\ndensity,τ=t−R/c, ˆe R =R/R. For convenience, we\nput the origin of the coordinate system in the middle of a\nsolenoid (inside a transmission electron microscope or a\nlinac). Hence,|r|< d/2, wheredis the solenoid length.\nUsing the expansion (10) we have calculated the poten-\ntials (see Eq. (B1)). To proceed further, we evaluate the\nelectric and magnetic fields. Exact expressions are pre-\nsented in the appendix (see Eq. (B2) for derived fields).\nThe fields can be represented as a sum:\nF=F far +F near,\nFfar ∝R −1,F near ∝R −2, (11)\nwhereF={E,H}. The termF far represents the radi-\nated part of the electromagnetic field, whileF near corre-\nsponds to the near field of the wave packet.\nThen, we find the Poynting vector,\nS= c\n4π E×H,(12)\nwhich we will further use to calculate both the radiated\npower and angular momentum of the radiation. The\nexact expression shown in Eq. (B3) indicates that the\nPoynting vector can be represented as the following sum:\nS=S far +S int +S near,\nSfar ∝R −2,S int ∝R −3,S near ∝R −4. (13)4\nAs we will see, the first term in the sum describes the\nradiation field and provides the leading contribution to\nthe radiation power, while the second term is essential\nwhen considering angular momentum of radiation. The\nnear-field term,S near, does not contribute to the radiated\nenergy or angular momentum.\nB. Power of radiation\nThe power (energy per unit of time) radiated by an\nNSLG electron in a magnetic field is given by the integral\nP(t) =\nZ\nS2\nS(t)·ds− − − − − →\nR→∞\nZ\nS2\nSfar (t)·ds(14)\nover a large sphereS 2 with the radiusR, where ds=\nR2dΩˆeR is the surface area of the infinitesimal sphere.\nThe unit vector ˆeR =R/Rcan be written using spherical\ncoordinates: ˆeR = sinθˆeR⊥ + cosθˆeZ. Unit vectors ˆeR⊥\nand ˆeZ are directed along the transversal radius-vector\nR⊥ (R⊥ =Rsinθ) andz-axis (Z=Rcosθ), respec-\ntively. From Eq. (13) we see that the only contribution\nto the power at distancesR→ ∞arises fromS far, while\nthe interference and near-field terms of the Poynting vec-\ntor lead to vanishing contributions. Hence, the r.h.s. of\nEq. (14) holds.\nThe dynamics of an NSLG electron in a magnetic field\nare periodic in time with the cyclotron period\nTc = 2π\n|ωc| = 2πmc\n|eH| .(15)\nTherefore, we calculate the average power over one pe-\nriod:\n⟨P⟩Tc = 1\nTc\nZ\nTc\nP(t) dt.(16)\nThe exact expression for⟨P⟩ Tc is given by Eq. (B4). Fig-\nure 2 shows the angular distribution of the time-averaged\nradiated power, calculated from Eq. (16). The emission\npattern is azimuthally symmetric and its dependence on\nthe polar angleθclosely resembles that of classic dipole\nradiation.\nEvaluating the integral in Eq. (16) yields:\n⟨P⟩Tc = (2n+|l|+ 1) 2 s2ω6\nc e2\n40c5\n\u0000\nσ4\nst −σ 4\nL\n\u0001\n,(17)\nwhereσ st — the deviation of the period-averaged wave\npacket’s width — andσ L are taken from Eqs. (5). We\ndemonstrate the results in Fig. 3 and discuss it in detail\nbelow in sec. III D.\nC. Angular momentum of radiation\nNext, we calculate the rate at which the electron’s\nOAM is carried away by the radiation. The flux den-\nsity of the angular momentum in the radial direction is\ngiven by\nf=lc= 1\nc R×S,(18)\nwherelis the angular momentum density. The rate of\nchange of the field’s angular momentum is then the inte-\ngral of this flux density over a large sphere:\ndL(t)\ndt =\nZ\nS2\nf(t) ds.(19)\nDecomposing the Poynting vector as in Eq. (13), we\nfind that the rate of change of angular momentum also\nconsists of three terms with different scaling properties:\ndL\ndt = dL\ndt far\n+ dL\ndt int\n+ dL\ndt near\n,\ndL\ndt far\n∝R 1, dL\ndt int\n∝R 0, dL\ndt near\n∝R −1.\n(20)\nAt first glance, the far-field term appears to diverge as\nR→ ∞. However, this term is oscillatory and its time\naverage over one cyclotron periodvanishes(see the text\nafter Eq. (B5) for the proof).\nTherefore, after time-averaging, the leading non-\nvanishing contribution to the net angular momentum loss\narises solely from theinterference term:\n*\ndL\ndt\n+\nTc\n= 1\nTc\nZ\nTc\ndL(t)\ndt int\ndt.(21)\nThereby, we emphasize that the OAM losses are defined\nby the next order contribution, 1/R3, with respect to the\nenergy emitted in the far field, 1/R 2.\nEvaluating this integral yields the time-averaged rate\nof the OAM lost by the electron:\n*\ndL\ndt\n+\nTc\n= (2n+|l|+ 1) 2 s2ω5\nc e2\n120c5\n\u0000\nσ4\nst −σ 4\nL\n\u0001\nˆeZ.(22)\nWe demonstrate the results in Fig. 4 and elaborate on\nthem in the following subsection.\nD. Analysis of results\nThe final expressions for the radiated power, Eq. (17),\nand the rate of OAM loss, Eq. (22), are structurally sim-\nilar and provide valuable physical insights. First, we note\nthat both expressions are proportional tos 2, wheresis\ndefined in Eq. (7). For stationary Landau states,s= 0,\nand consequently, there is no radiation. In our semiclas-\nsical model, such a stationary current configuration only\ngenerates a quasi-static near field.\nFor a general NSLG state (s̸= 0), the radiated power\nand rate of OAM loss are highly sensitive to the magnetic5\nFIG. 2: Angular distribution of the period-averaged radiation power⟨dP/dΩ⟩ Tc ∝(1 + cos 2 θ) sin2 θ.

The value of\nσ′\n0 =−3.1×10 −4cwas taken from Ref. [19] that has been thoroughly considered in sec. V B of [12]. The following\nparameters are used:H= 1 T (corresponding toσ L ≈26 nm andℏω c ≈10 −4 eV),n= 0,l= 10. The panels show\nthe dependence over three distinct scales ofσ 0: (a) nanometers, (b) micrometers, and (c) sub-millimeters.\nfield, scaling as⟨P⟩ Tc ∝H 6 and⟨dL/dt⟩ Tc ∝H 5. Note\nthat⟨dL/dt⟩ Tc is an odd function of the magnetic field’s\nz-axis projection meaning the electron can both lose and\ngain OAM depending on the field direction. The depen-\ndence on the field is also notably steeper than theP∝H 4\nscaling of the nonrelativistic synchrotron radiation [20].\nImportantly, in our setup the radiation characteristics\ncan be tuned by varying the magnetic field strength in-\ndependently, without the need to adjust the electron’s\nenergy to maintain its trajectory as is required in syn-\nchrotrons.\nThe power and OAM loss scale as (2n+|l|+1) 2. Since\nvortex electrons typically have|l| ≫n, the radiation\npower and angular momentum are approximately pro-\nportional to|l| 2. Thus, particles with higher OAM radi-\nate more intensely, although this usually implies a larger\ninitial wave packet radius.\nFinally, the radiation characteristics are proportional\nto the termσ 4\nst −σ 4\nL, directly linking the emission to\nthe initial conditions: wave packets that are larger or\nexpand more rapidly upon entering the solenoid radiate\nmore intensely.\nTo illustrate the magnitude of the radiated power and\nOAM loss rate, we use a typical set of parameters for\na transmission electron microscope (TEM) in figures.\n3 and 4: a longitudinal kinetic energyE ∥ = 200 keV\n(v≈0.7c), ad= 20 cm long solenoid, and anH= 1 T\nmagnetic field (σ L ≈26,ℏω c ≈10 −4eV). These val-\nues correspond to a flight timet flight ≡d/v≈1 ns, or\nabout 30 cyclotron periods (T c ≈36 ps). The quantum\nnumbers are6\nFIG. 4: Period-averaged OAM loss rate as a function of the initial wave packet’s width deviationσ 0.

The panels show\nthe dependence over three distinct scales ofσ 0: (a) nanometers, (b) micrometers, and (c) sub-millimeters.\nn= 0,\nl= 10, (23)\nif not stated otherwise. These parameters are also char-\nacteristic of a solenoid within a linac but with the elec-\ntron’s near-luminal velocity (v≈c) being the primary\ndifference. For a fixed solenoid length, this higher veloc-\nity reduces the total interaction time, resulting in slightly\nless total radiated energy and OAM.\nAs shown in Fig. 3, the calculated radiated power for\nthe TEM parameters is highly sensitive to the initial wave\npacket width. It scales from 10 −7 eV/s for nanometer-\nscale widths up to 10 4 eV/s for sub-millimeter widths.\nDespite this large range, the total radiated energy over\nthe 20 cm path (t flight ≈1 ns) remains extremely small,\nreaching a maximum of only 10−5 eV. This value is more\nthan an order of magnitude smaller than the cyclotron\nenergy quantum (ℏωc ≈10 −4 eV). This implies that for\na typical TEM setup the probability of emitting even a\nsingle photon is very low, and the electron’s energy loss is\nnegligible. However, the situation changes dramatically\nfor longer travel distances. For example, in a 1-km-long\nlinac section (t flight ≈3.5µs), an electron with similar\ntransverse parameters would radiate a total energy of\napproximately 3.5·10 −2 eV. This energy corresponds to\nthe emission of roughly 350 photons at the cyclotron fre-\nquency, indicating that the radiation becomes a signifi-\ncant physical effect.\nFig. 4 presents our central result: the calculated rate\nof OAM loss. For the parameters considered, this rate\nvaries dramatically with the initial wave packet size, from\na minuscule 10 −14ℏ/s for nanometer-scale packets to a\nmaximum of about 0.1ℏ/s for sub-millimeter packets. To\nplace this in a practical context, we can extrapolate these\nfindings to a kilometer-scale linac. Even for a wide wave\npacket experiencing the maximum loss rate, the total\nOAM shed during a 1-km transit (t flight ≈3.5µs) would\nbe ∆L z ≈10 −7ℏ. This loss is utterly negligible com-\npared to the initial OAM of the vortex electron (|l| ≥1).\nBased on this analysis, we come to a key conclusion: the\nloss of OAM for vortex electrons propagating through the\nmagnetic fields typical of linacs is negligible. Therefore,\nlinacs can be considered a robust and reliable platform\nfor accelerating vortex electrons to relativistic energies,\nat least within a quasi-classical approximation.\nE. Applicability of semiclassical approach\nA key assumption of our semiclassical model is that\nthe emission of very few soft photons does not change the\nquantum state of the electron much. Its wave function is\nassumed to evolve according to the Schr¨ odinger equation\nwith a fixed external field, and the back-action of the\nemitted radiation on this state is neglected.\nTo validate this assumption, we compare the energy\nradiated during one cyclotron period,\nErad =⟨P⟩ TcTc,(24)\nwith the expectation value of the electron’s transverse\nenergy,\nE⊥ = ℏωc\n2 (2n+|l|+ 1) σ2\nst\nσ2\nL\n+lµ BH,(25)\nwhereµ B =|e|ℏ/2mcis the Bohr magneton.\nThe semiclassical approach remains self-consistent as\nlong as the radiated energy is a small fraction of the\nparticle’s transverse energy, i.e.,E rad ≪E ⊥. To verify7\nFIG. 5: The ratio of the energy radiated for one cyclotron period to the energy of the electron’s transverse motion,\nErad/E⊥, as a function of the initial transversal size deviationσ 0 of the wave packet. The following parameters are\nused:H= 1 T (corresponding toσ L ≈26 nm andℏω c ≈10 −4 eV),σ ′\n0 = 0,n= 0. The panels show the dependence\nover three distinct scales ofσ 0: (a) nanometers, (b) micrometers, and (c) sub-millimeters.\nthis, we plot the ratio of the energy radiated per cy-\nclotron period to the transverse energy in Fig. 5. For\nthe parameter set considered, this ratio is indeed much\nless than unity. We can extend this validity check to\nour most extreme scenario: a sub-millimeter wave packet\ntraversing a 1-kilometer linac. Over the entire flight time\n(tflight ≈3.5µs, or∼10 5Tc), the total radiated energy\nstill constitutes no more than 10−6 of the electron’s trans-\nverse energy. This confirms that the back-action of radia-\ntion is negligible and robustly validates our semiclassical\ntreatment even for kilometer-scale acceleration.\nThe interval of characteristic time of loss of one OAM\nquantum lies within the range 10 3 −10 27 seconds. QED\napproach, applied in [21] to evaluate the lifetime of a\nLandau state in the accelerator’s magnetic field, shows\nsimilarly large results forH= 1 T and kinetic energies of\nvortex particles around several MeV. This indicates the\nrelevancy of semiclassical calculations since, as results in\nRef. [21] also demonstrate, radiation of vortex electrons\ntransitioning through a solenoid carries negligibly small\nintensity, and the theory predicts a large lifetime of the\nconsidered NSLG states.\nIV. DISCUSSION\nOur semiclassical approach, which treats the electron’s\nwave function as a coherent ”charge cloud”, is central\nto an ongoing debate in the literature on how to model\nsingle-particle radiation [22–25]. An alternative perspec-\ntive suggests an incoherent model, where radiation in-\ntensity is integrated over the probability distribution.\nExperimentally distinguishing between these competing\ntheoretical frameworks — for instance, using a TEM —\nremains a crucial open challenge and a promising direc-\ntion for future research.\nOur semiclassical results must also be considered in the\ncontext of a full QED treatment, which includes sponta-\nneous quantum transitions between energy levels —– a\nchannel absent in our model. We hypothesize that a rig-\norous QED calculation for an NSLG state would reveal\nboth this ”quantum” radiation and the classical compo-\nnent from the wave packet’s dynamics. This raises funda-\nmental questions about how these two contributions are\nencoded within QED, whether they can be separated,\nand how they might interfere.\nPlausibly, for ”sufficiently nonstationary” states, the\n”classical” radiation mechanism we describe might dom-\ninate over the “quantum” one. A critical open question is\nthe quantitative criterion for this classical regime, which\nis supposed to be a condition likeσ st −σ L ≫σ L.\nA final practical consideration is the radiation from the\nsolenoid’s fringe fields. As detailed in Appendix C, the\ninhomogeneous fields in this region generate a transient\nburst of radiation with possibly high values of angular\nmomentum as the electron enters and exits. Crucially,\nthis transition signal is experimentally distinguishable\nfrom the continuous, periodic radiation generated within\nthe uniform field. This separation allows for a clear ex-\nperimental test of our central predictions for the steady-\nstate emission.8\nV. CONCLUSION\nIn this work, we have developed a semiclassical model\nto investigate the radiation emitted by a vortex elec-\ntron propagating through a longitudinal magnetic field,\nsuch as in a linear accelerator. Our key finding is that\nboth the radiated energy and the change in the electron’s\nOAM are extremely small for realistic accelerator param-\neters. Even when extrapolated to a kilometer-scale linac,\nthe total energy radiated remains a negligible fraction of\nthe electron’s transverse energy, which in turn validates\nour semiclassical approach. More importantly, the total\nchange in OAM is found to be minuscule, far less than a\nsingle quantum ofℏ. In other words, we have found that\na single quantum of OAM is emitted in a typical time of\nat least 103 seconds, much longer than the acceleration\ntime even in a km-long linac.\nWe therefore arrive at a clear and impactful conclu-\nsion: the orbital angular momentum of vortex electrons\nis remarkably robust during acceleration in linacs. This\nresult strongly supports the viability of using linacs to\nproduce high-energy, relativistic vortex electron beams\nfor future applications in materials science and particle\nphysics.\nVI.

The corresponding\ncyclotron frequency and period areω c ≈3.34×10 11 rad/s\nandT c ≈18.8 ps, respectively.\nA relativistic electron traverses the fringe field re-\ngion of length 2Din a timet trans ∼2D/c≈67 ps.\nSince the transit time is longer than the cyclotron period\n(ttrans ≈T c), the magnetic field experienced by the elec-\ntron changes slowly over a single cyclotron period. This\njustifies the use of the adiabatic approximation, where\nthe rate of change of the field is small compared to its\ncharacteristic frequency scales:\n\f\f\f\f\n∂ωc\n∂t\n\f\f\f\f ≪ ωc\nTc\n∼ω 2\nc .(C1)\nUnder this condition, we can show that an approxi-\nmate solution to the Schr¨ odinger equation (1) remains\nan NSLG state (3), but with a time-dependent cyclotron\nfrequency. This follows from the analysis of the equa-\ntions for the optical functions, which retain their form\nwith the magnetic length now being a function of time:\nσL →σ L (t) =\np\n2ℏc/|eH(t)|.\nTo simplify the calculation, we model the change in the\ncyclotron frequency across the transition region as lin-\near, i.e.,ω c(t)≈ω ′\nct, where the constant rate of change\nisω ′\nc ≈ω c/ttrans. Then, we repeat the derivation from\n[12], substituting this time-dependent frequency into the\nsystem of optical equations [23] in that paper.

    "combined_content": "Abstract Content:\nWhen a vortex electron with an orbital angular momentum (OAM) enters a\nmagnetic field, its quantum state is described with a nonstationary\nLaguerre-Gaussian (NSLG) state rather than with a stationary Landau state. A\nkey feature of these NSLG states is oscillations of the electron wave packet's\nroot-mean-square (r.m.s.) radius, similar to betatron oscillations.\nClassically, such an oscillating charge distribution is expected to emit\nphotons. This raises a critical question: does this radiation carry away OAM,\nleading to a loss of the electron's vorticity? To investigate this, we solve\nMaxwell's equations using the charge and current densities derived from an\nelectron in the NSLG state. We calculate the total radiated power and the\nangular momentum of the emitted field, quantifying the rate at which a vortex\nelectron loses its energy and OAM while propagating in a longitudinal magnetic\nfield.

A key feature of these NSLG states is oscillations of the electron wave\npacket’s root-mean-square (r.m.s.) radius, similar to betatron oscillations. Classically, such an\noscillating charge distribution is expected to emit photons. This raises a critical question: does\nthis radiation carry away OAM, leading to a loss of the electron’s vorticity? To investigate this,\nwe solve Maxwell’s equations using the charge and current densities derived from an electron in\nthe NSLG state. We calculate the total radiated power and the angular momentum of the emitted\nfield, quantifying the rate at which a vortex electron loses its energy and OAM while propagating\nin a longitudinal magnetic field. We find both the radiated power and the angular momentum\nlosses to be negligible indicating that linear accelerators (linacs) appear to be a prominent tool\nfor maintaining vorticity of relativistic vortex electrons and other charged particles, at least in the\nquasi-classical approximation.\nI. INTRODUCTION\nVortex, or twisted, electrons are electrons in specific\nquantum states with a definite projection of an orbital\nangular momentum (OAM) along their propagation axis\n[1–3]. Their OAM results in a magnetic moment that can\nsignificantly exceed its spin-originated counterpart. This\nproperty makes vortex electrons promising for numerous\napplications in material science, chemistry, and particle\nphysics [3–5]. However, in particle physics, specifically,\nelectrons are required with energies in the GeV range,\nwhereas the highest energy achieved for a vortex electron\nto date is only about 300 keV [3, 6, 7].\nA straightforward approach to obtaining high-energy\nvortex electrons is to first generate twisted electrons at\nlow energies and then accelerate them. While the curvi-\nlinear sections of accelerators are likely unsuitable since\nthey lack axial symmetry, linear accelerators (linacs) ap-\npear to be appropriate for this purpose. However, a crit-\nical question arises: do these particles preserve their vor-\nticity as they travel through the accelerator’s electromag-\nnetic fields? Specifically, could the small but inevitable\nradiation losses in a linac lead to a significant decrease\nin the particle’s OAM?\nHere we make a very first step towards addressing this\nquestion by employing a semiclassical approach for find-\n∗ george.zmaga@mail.ru\n† georgii.sizykh@metalab.ifmo.ru\n‡ dmitriy.grosman@metalab.ifmo.ru\n§ mengq8@mail2.sysu.edu.cn\n¶ zoulp5@mail.sysu.edu.cn\n∗∗ zhangpm5@mail.sysu.edu.cn\n†† dmitry.karlovets@metalab.ifmo.ru\ning the radiated power and the corresponding loss of an-\ngular momentum. Our method begins with the wave-\nfunction of a vortex electron, from which we derive the\nprobability density and current. Multiplying by the elec-\ntric charge and interpreting these densities as the effec-\ntive distribution of the electric charge and current, we\nthen use them as the source terms on the right-hand side\nof Maxwell’s equations.\nWe model the linac as a region with homogeneous, lon-\ngitudinal electric and magnetic fields. The primary role\nof the electric field is acceleration, and its contribution to\nradiation is negligible. Therefore, our analysis of radia-\ntion focuses exclusively on the effects of the longitudinal\nmagnetic field.\nA vortex electron in free space is most realistically\ndescribed with a free nonstationary Laguerre-Gaussian\n(NSLGf) state [3, 8–14]. Due to its nonstationary dynam-\nics, the electron cannot be described with a stationary\nLandau state upon entering the magnetic field. Instead,\nits motion is accurately characterized with the nonsta-\ntionary counterparts of Landau states: NSLG states in a\nmagnetic field [12, 13, 15–18]. Their distinguishing fea-\nture lies in oscillations of the state’s root-mean-square\n(r.m.s.) radius, resembling the phenomenon of betatron\noscillations. Consequently, even within a magnetic field\ncollinear with its average momentum, the electron’s wave\npacket behaves as a “breathing” charge cloud. From the\nperspective of classical electrodynamics, such an oscil-\nlating charge distribution must radiate, and calculating\nthe characteristics of this radiation is the primary focus\nof this work. We illustrate our results in two experi-\nmentally relevant scenarios — for electron microscopes\nand linacs. Examining both of these, it is shown that the\nlosses of OAM are negligible in the vast majority of cases,\nthus enabling transport and focusing of vortex electrons,\narXiv:2509.21195v1  [quant-ph]  25 Sep 20252\nprotons, or ions in the longitudinal magnetic fields.\nThroughout this paper, we use CGS units and define\nthe electron charge ase <0.\nII. NSLG STATES\nIn this section we briefly review NSLG states (a thor-\nough analysis of them can be found in [12]). These are an\northogonal complete set of nonstationaryexactsolutions\nto the Schr¨ odinger equation,\niℏ∂tψ(r, t) =( ˆp−eA/c) 2\n2m ψ(r, t),(1)\nwhere ˆp=−iℏ∇and the external field vector potential\nA=0in free space and\nA= Hr⊥\n2 ˆeϕ (2)\nin a constant homogeneous longitudinal magnetic field.\nIn free space the transverse dynamics of a spatially lo-\ncalized vortex electron is described with an NSLG f state\n(see Sec. 2.3 in [12]),\nΨn,l(r⊥, t) =N⊥\nr|l|\n⊥\nσ|l|+1(t)L|l|\nn\n\u0012 r2\n⊥\nσ2(t)\n\u0013\n×\nexp\n\u0014\nilϕ−iΦ G(t)− r2\n⊥\n2σ2(t)\n\u0012\n1−i σ2(t)\nλCR(t)\n\u0013\u0015\n,\n(3)\nwhereλ C =ℏ/(mc) is the reduced Compton wavelength,\nn∈ {0,1,2...}andl∈ {0,±1,±2...}are radial and or-\nbital quantum numbers,N ⊥ is the normalization con-\nstant (see Eq.

(10) in [12].\nAn important feature of such a state is the r.m.s. ra-\ndius,\nq\n⟨r2\n⊥⟩ − ⟨r⊥⟩2\nf\n=ϱ f(t) =σ f(t)\np\n2n+|l|+ 1.(4)\nHence, when such a vortex electron approaches a solenoid\nfrom free space it spreads, which prevents it from contin-\nuously transitioning into a stationary Landau state [13].\nNonetheless, a continuous state can be constructed by\nconsidering NSLG states within the field instead of Lan-\ndau states. They are solutions to Eq. (1) with the vector\npotential in the symmetric gauge (see Eq. (2)). NSLG\nstates in the magnetic field have the same form (3) as\nin free space albeit with different optical functionsσ(t),\nR(t), and ΦG(t). The r.m.s. radius is still determined by\ngeneral Eq. (4). Its evolution is governed by the devia-\ntion functionσ(t), which is now given by\nσ(t) =σ st\nvuut1 +\ns\n1−\n\u0012σL\nσst\n\u00134\nsin (sωct−ϑ),\nσ2\nst = σ2\n0\n2\n \n1 +\n\u0012σL\nσ0\n\u00134\n+\n\u0012 σ′\n0σ2\nL\ncλCσ0\n\u00132!\n,\nϑ= arcsin 1−(σ 0/σst)2\nq\n1−(σ L/σst)4\n.\n(5)\nHereσ 0 andσ ′\n0 are initial values of the wave packet’s\nwidth deviation and its derivative that are dictated by\nthe state of the incident free-space wave packet;ω c =\neH/(mc) is the cyclotron frequency, and\nσL =\ns\n2ℏc\n|eH| (6)\nis the r.m.s. radius of the Landau state withn=l= 0.\nThe deviation functionσ(t) indicates the wave packet’s\ntransverse size oscillates with the cyclotron frequency.\nThe sign function\ns≡s(σ 0, σ′\n0) =\n\n\n\nsign(σ′\n0), σ′\n0 ̸= 0,\nsign(σL −σ 0), σ′\n0 = 0 andσ 0 ̸=σ L,\n0, σ′\n0 = 0 andσ 0 =σ L;\n(7)\ndetermines whether the wave packet initially expands or\ncontracts.

(10)\nin [12] using the dispersion equations (5).\nThe electron’s OAM is independent of its longitudi-\nnal motion, which is unaffected by the vacuum-solenoid\nboundary crossing. Thus, we choose it to be a simple\nGaussian wave packet with the average longitudinal mo-\nmentump 0 and the “size”σ z (A1) short enough that the\nelectron dynamics remain unchanged when passing the\ntransition region, as detailed in the Supplemental Mate-\nrial of Ref.

As it\npropagates along thez-axis, its wave function oscillates (the “breathing” NSLG mode). This non-stationary charge\ndistribution emits radiation. The field emitted from a source pointrat an earlier timeτis observed at a distant\npointR.\nA UNIFORM EXTERNAL MAGNETIC FIELD\nA. Characteristics of emitted radiation\nFrom a classical electrodynamics perspective, Eqs. (8)\ndescribe a non-uniformly moving charge cloud, which\nmust emit electromagnetic waves.

The\nsetup it schematically depicted in Fig. 1.\nAt this point, we employ the standard far-field ap-\nproximation, assuming that the characteristic size of the\nradiating system is much smaller than the distance to\nthe observation point. However, in addition to the time-\nderivative term, we also take into account the one aris-\ning from the denominator expansion. This term provides\nthe leading-order contribution to the angular momentum\nof radiation, althoughit is irrelevant for the radiation\npower.\nAccordingly, we expand integrands in Eq. (9) into a\nseries:\nf(r, t′)\n|R−r| ≈ f(r, τ)\nR + r·ˆeR ∂τ f(r, τ)\nRc + r·ˆeR f(r, τ)\nR2 ,\n(10)\nwherefis a charge density or the component of a current\ndensity,τ=t−R/c, ˆe R =R/R. For convenience, we\nput the origin of the coordinate system in the middle of a\nsolenoid (inside a transmission electron microscope or a\nlinac). Hence,|r|< d/2, wheredis the solenoid length.\nUsing the expansion (10) we have calculated the poten-\ntials (see Eq. (B1)). To proceed further, we evaluate the\nelectric and magnetic fields. Exact expressions are pre-\nsented in the appendix (see Eq. (B2) for derived fields).\nThe fields can be represented as a sum:\nF=F far +F near,\nFfar ∝R −1,F near ∝R −2, (11)\nwhereF={E,H}. The termF far represents the radi-\nated part of the electromagnetic field, whileF near corre-\nsponds to the near field of the wave packet.\nThen, we find the Poynting vector,\nS= c\n4π E×H,(12)\nwhich we will further use to calculate both the radiated\npower and angular momentum of the radiation. The\nexact expression shown in Eq. (B3) indicates that the\nPoynting vector can be represented as the following sum:\nS=S far +S int +S near,\nSfar ∝R −2,S int ∝R −3,S near ∝R −4. (13)4\nAs we will see, the first term in the sum describes the\nradiation field and provides the leading contribution to\nthe radiation power, while the second term is essential\nwhen considering angular momentum of radiation. The\nnear-field term,S near, does not contribute to the radiated\nenergy or angular momentum.\nB. Power of radiation\nThe power (energy per unit of time) radiated by an\nNSLG electron in a magnetic field is given by the integral\nP(t) =\nZ\nS2\nS(t)·ds− − − − − →\nR→∞\nZ\nS2\nSfar (t)·ds(14)\nover a large sphereS 2 with the radiusR, where ds=\nR2dΩˆeR is the surface area of the infinitesimal sphere.\nThe unit vector ˆeR =R/Rcan be written using spherical\ncoordinates: ˆeR = sinθˆeR⊥ + cosθˆeZ. Unit vectors ˆeR⊥\nand ˆeZ are directed along the transversal radius-vector\nR⊥ (R⊥ =Rsinθ) andz-axis (Z=Rcosθ), respec-\ntively. From Eq. (13) we see that the only contribution\nto the power at distancesR→ ∞arises fromS far, while\nthe interference and near-field terms of the Poynting vec-\ntor lead to vanishing contributions. Hence, the r.h.s. of\nEq. (14) holds.\nThe dynamics of an NSLG electron in a magnetic field\nare periodic in time with the cyclotron period\nTc = 2π\n|ωc| = 2πmc\n|eH| .(15)\nTherefore, we calculate the average power over one pe-\nriod:\n⟨P⟩Tc = 1\nTc\nZ\nTc\nP(t) dt.(16)\nThe exact expression for⟨P⟩ Tc is given by Eq. (B4). Fig-\nure 2 shows the angular distribution of the time-averaged\nradiated power, calculated from Eq. (16). The emission\npattern is azimuthally symmetric and its dependence on\nthe polar angleθclosely resembles that of classic dipole\nradiation.\nEvaluating the integral in Eq. (16) yields:\n⟨P⟩Tc = (2n+|l|+ 1) 2 s2ω6\nc e2\n40c5\n\u0000\nσ4\nst −σ 4\nL\n\u0001\n,(17)\nwhereσ st — the deviation of the period-averaged wave\npacket’s width — andσ L are taken from Eqs. (5). We\ndemonstrate the results in Fig. 3 and discuss it in detail\nbelow in sec. III D.\nC. Angular momentum of radiation\nNext, we calculate the rate at which the electron’s\nOAM is carried away by the radiation. The flux den-\nsity of the angular momentum in the radial direction is\ngiven by\nf=lc= 1\nc R×S,(18)\nwherelis the angular momentum density. The rate of\nchange of the field’s angular momentum is then the inte-\ngral of this flux density over a large sphere:\ndL(t)\ndt =\nZ\nS2\nf(t) ds.(19)\nDecomposing the Poynting vector as in Eq. (13), we\nfind that the rate of change of angular momentum also\nconsists of three terms with different scaling properties:\ndL\ndt = dL\ndt far\n+ dL\ndt int\n+ dL\ndt near\n,\ndL\ndt far\n∝R 1, dL\ndt int\n∝R 0, dL\ndt near\n∝R −1.\n(20)\nAt first glance, the far-field term appears to diverge as\nR→ ∞. However, this term is oscillatory and its time\naverage over one cyclotron periodvanishes(see the text\nafter Eq. (B5) for the proof).\nTherefore, after time-averaging, the leading non-\nvanishing contribution to the net angular momentum loss\narises solely from theinterference term:\n*\ndL\ndt\n+\nTc\n= 1\nTc\nZ\nTc\ndL(t)\ndt int\ndt.(21)\nThereby, we emphasize that the OAM losses are defined\nby the next order contribution, 1/R3, with respect to the\nenergy emitted in the far field, 1/R 2.\nEvaluating this integral yields the time-averaged rate\nof the OAM lost by the electron:\n*\ndL\ndt\n+\nTc\n= (2n+|l|+ 1) 2 s2ω5\nc e2\n120c5\n\u0000\nσ4\nst −σ 4\nL\n\u0001\nˆeZ.(22)\nWe demonstrate the results in Fig. 4 and elaborate on\nthem in the following subsection.\nD. Analysis of results\nThe final expressions for the radiated power, Eq. (17),\nand the rate of OAM loss, Eq. (22), are structurally sim-\nilar and provide valuable physical insights. First, we note\nthat both expressions are proportional tos 2, wheresis\ndefined in Eq. (7). For stationary Landau states,s= 0,\nand consequently, there is no radiation. In our semiclas-\nsical model, such a stationary current configuration only\ngenerates a quasi-static near field.\nFor a general NSLG state (s̸= 0), the radiated power\nand rate of OAM loss are highly sensitive to the magnetic5\nFIG. 2: Angular distribution of the period-averaged radiation power⟨dP/dΩ⟩ Tc ∝(1 + cos 2 θ) sin2 θ.

The value of\nσ′\n0 =−3.1×10 −4cwas taken from Ref. [19] that has been thoroughly considered in sec. V B of [12]. The following\nparameters are used:H= 1 T (corresponding toσ L ≈26 nm andℏω c ≈10 −4 eV),n= 0,l= 10. The panels show\nthe dependence over three distinct scales ofσ 0: (a) nanometers, (b) micrometers, and (c) sub-millimeters.\nfield, scaling as⟨P⟩ Tc ∝H 6 and⟨dL/dt⟩ Tc ∝H 5. Note\nthat⟨dL/dt⟩ Tc is an odd function of the magnetic field’s\nz-axis projection meaning the electron can both lose and\ngain OAM depending on the field direction. The depen-\ndence on the field is also notably steeper than theP∝H 4\nscaling of the nonrelativistic synchrotron radiation [20].\nImportantly, in our setup the radiation characteristics\ncan be tuned by varying the magnetic field strength in-\ndependently, without the need to adjust the electron’s\nenergy to maintain its trajectory as is required in syn-\nchrotrons.\nThe power and OAM loss scale as (2n+|l|+1) 2. Since\nvortex electrons typically have|l| ≫n, the radiation\npower and angular momentum are approximately pro-\nportional to|l| 2. Thus, particles with higher OAM radi-\nate more intensely, although this usually implies a larger\ninitial wave packet radius.\nFinally, the radiation characteristics are proportional\nto the termσ 4\nst −σ 4\nL, directly linking the emission to\nthe initial conditions: wave packets that are larger or\nexpand more rapidly upon entering the solenoid radiate\nmore intensely.\nTo illustrate the magnitude of the radiated power and\nOAM loss rate, we use a typical set of parameters for\na transmission electron microscope (TEM) in figures.\n3 and 4: a longitudinal kinetic energyE ∥ = 200 keV\n(v≈0.7c), ad= 20 cm long solenoid, and anH= 1 T\nmagnetic field (σ L ≈26,ℏω c ≈10 −4eV). These val-\nues correspond to a flight timet flight ≡d/v≈1 ns, or\nabout 30 cyclotron periods (T c ≈36 ps). The quantum\nnumbers are6\nFIG. 4: Period-averaged OAM loss rate as a function of the initial wave packet’s width deviationσ 0.

The panels show\nthe dependence over three distinct scales ofσ 0: (a) nanometers, (b) micrometers, and (c) sub-millimeters.\nn= 0,\nl= 10, (23)\nif not stated otherwise. These parameters are also char-\nacteristic of a solenoid within a linac but with the elec-\ntron’s near-luminal velocity (v≈c) being the primary\ndifference. For a fixed solenoid length, this higher veloc-\nity reduces the total interaction time, resulting in slightly\nless total radiated energy and OAM.\nAs shown in Fig. 3, the calculated radiated power for\nthe TEM parameters is highly sensitive to the initial wave\npacket width. It scales from 10 −7 eV/s for nanometer-\nscale widths up to 10 4 eV/s for sub-millimeter widths.\nDespite this large range, the total radiated energy over\nthe 20 cm path (t flight ≈1 ns) remains extremely small,\nreaching a maximum of only 10−5 eV. This value is more\nthan an order of magnitude smaller than the cyclotron\nenergy quantum (ℏωc ≈10 −4 eV). This implies that for\na typical TEM setup the probability of emitting even a\nsingle photon is very low, and the electron’s energy loss is\nnegligible. However, the situation changes dramatically\nfor longer travel distances. For example, in a 1-km-long\nlinac section (t flight ≈3.5µs), an electron with similar\ntransverse parameters would radiate a total energy of\napproximately 3.5·10 −2 eV. This energy corresponds to\nthe emission of roughly 350 photons at the cyclotron fre-\nquency, indicating that the radiation becomes a signifi-\ncant physical effect.\nFig. 4 presents our central result: the calculated rate\nof OAM loss. For the parameters considered, this rate\nvaries dramatically with the initial wave packet size, from\na minuscule 10 −14ℏ/s for nanometer-scale packets to a\nmaximum of about 0.1ℏ/s for sub-millimeter packets. To\nplace this in a practical context, we can extrapolate these\nfindings to a kilometer-scale linac. Even for a wide wave\npacket experiencing the maximum loss rate, the total\nOAM shed during a 1-km transit (t flight ≈3.5µs) would\nbe ∆L z ≈10 −7ℏ. This loss is utterly negligible com-\npared to the initial OAM of the vortex electron (|l| ≥1).\nBased on this analysis, we come to a key conclusion: the\nloss of OAM for vortex electrons propagating through the\nmagnetic fields typical of linacs is negligible. Therefore,\nlinacs can be considered a robust and reliable platform\nfor accelerating vortex electrons to relativistic energies,\nat least within a quasi-classical approximation.\nE. Applicability of semiclassical approach\nA key assumption of our semiclassical model is that\nthe emission of very few soft photons does not change the\nquantum state of the electron much. Its wave function is\nassumed to evolve according to the Schr¨ odinger equation\nwith a fixed external field, and the back-action of the\nemitted radiation on this state is neglected.\nTo validate this assumption, we compare the energy\nradiated during one cyclotron period,\nErad =⟨P⟩ TcTc,(24)\nwith the expectation value of the electron’s transverse\nenergy,\nE⊥ = ℏωc\n2 (2n+|l|+ 1) σ2\nst\nσ2\nL\n+lµ BH,(25)\nwhereµ B =|e|ℏ/2mcis the Bohr magneton.\nThe semiclassical approach remains self-consistent as\nlong as the radiated energy is a small fraction of the\nparticle’s transverse energy, i.e.,E rad ≪E ⊥. To verify7\nFIG. 5: The ratio of the energy radiated for one cyclotron period to the energy of the electron’s transverse motion,\nErad/E⊥, as a function of the initial transversal size deviationσ 0 of the wave packet. The following parameters are\nused:H= 1 T (corresponding toσ L ≈26 nm andℏω c ≈10 −4 eV),σ ′\n0 = 0,n= 0. The panels show the dependence\nover three distinct scales ofσ 0: (a) nanometers, (b) micrometers, and (c) sub-millimeters.\nthis, we plot the ratio of the energy radiated per cy-\nclotron period to the transverse energy in Fig. 5. For\nthe parameter set considered, this ratio is indeed much\nless than unity. We can extend this validity check to\nour most extreme scenario: a sub-millimeter wave packet\ntraversing a 1-kilometer linac. Over the entire flight time\n(tflight ≈3.5µs, or∼10 5Tc), the total radiated energy\nstill constitutes no more than 10−6 of the electron’s trans-\nverse energy. This confirms that the back-action of radia-\ntion is negligible and robustly validates our semiclassical\ntreatment even for kilometer-scale acceleration.\nThe interval of characteristic time of loss of one OAM\nquantum lies within the range 10 3 −10 27 seconds. QED\napproach, applied in [21] to evaluate the lifetime of a\nLandau state in the accelerator’s magnetic field, shows\nsimilarly large results forH= 1 T and kinetic energies of\nvortex particles around several MeV. This indicates the\nrelevancy of semiclassical calculations since, as results in\nRef. [21] also demonstrate, radiation of vortex electrons\ntransitioning through a solenoid carries negligibly small\nintensity, and the theory predicts a large lifetime of the\nconsidered NSLG states.\nIV. DISCUSSION\nOur semiclassical approach, which treats the electron’s\nwave function as a coherent ”charge cloud”, is central\nto an ongoing debate in the literature on how to model\nsingle-particle radiation [22–25]. An alternative perspec-\ntive suggests an incoherent model, where radiation in-\ntensity is integrated over the probability distribution.\nExperimentally distinguishing between these competing\ntheoretical frameworks — for instance, using a TEM —\nremains a crucial open challenge and a promising direc-\ntion for future research.\nOur semiclassical results must also be considered in the\ncontext of a full QED treatment, which includes sponta-\nneous quantum transitions between energy levels —– a\nchannel absent in our model. We hypothesize that a rig-\norous QED calculation for an NSLG state would reveal\nboth this ”quantum” radiation and the classical compo-\nnent from the wave packet’s dynamics. This raises funda-\nmental questions about how these two contributions are\nencoded within QED, whether they can be separated,\nand how they might interfere.\nPlausibly, for ”sufficiently nonstationary” states, the\n”classical” radiation mechanism we describe might dom-\ninate over the “quantum” one. A critical open question is\nthe quantitative criterion for this classical regime, which\nis supposed to be a condition likeσ st −σ L ≫σ L.\nA final practical consideration is the radiation from the\nsolenoid’s fringe fields. As detailed in Appendix C, the\ninhomogeneous fields in this region generate a transient\nburst of radiation with possibly high values of angular\nmomentum as the electron enters and exits. Crucially,\nthis transition signal is experimentally distinguishable\nfrom the continuous, periodic radiation generated within\nthe uniform field. This separation allows for a clear ex-\nperimental test of our central predictions for the steady-\nstate emission.8\nV. CONCLUSION\nIn this work, we have developed a semiclassical model\nto investigate the radiation emitted by a vortex elec-\ntron propagating through a longitudinal magnetic field,\nsuch as in a linear accelerator. Our key finding is that\nboth the radiated energy and the change in the electron’s\nOAM are extremely small for realistic accelerator param-\neters. Even when extrapolated to a kilometer-scale linac,\nthe total energy radiated remains a negligible fraction of\nthe electron’s transverse energy, which in turn validates\nour semiclassical approach. More importantly, the total\nchange in OAM is found to be minuscule, far less than a\nsingle quantum ofℏ. In other words, we have found that\na single quantum of OAM is emitted in a typical time of\nat least 103 seconds, much longer than the acceleration\ntime even in a km-long linac.\nWe therefore arrive at a clear and impactful conclu-\nsion: the orbital angular momentum of vortex electrons\nis remarkably robust during acceleration in linacs. This\nresult strongly supports the viability of using linacs to\nproduce high-energy, relativistic vortex electron beams\nfor future applications in materials science and particle\nphysics.\nVI.

Onlyz-component remains and is determined by\nthe following expression:\ndLz\ndt far\n= e2Rωc\n30c6 ∂3\nt ϱ2(t)∂2\nt ϱ2(t).(B6)\nAccording to the first line in Eq.

Thus, averag-\ning terms∂ n\nt ϱ2(t)∂m\nt ϱ2(t) withnandmof different par-\nity over the cyclotron period results in zero. Hence, far10\nfields do not contribute to the angular momentum rate\nof change.\nAppendix C: Influence of solenoid fringe fields on\nthe radiation\nWe consider a setup with a solenoid of diameterD∼1\ncm and an internal field ofH= 1 T. The corresponding\ncyclotron frequency and period areω c ≈3.34×10 11 rad/s\nandT c ≈18.8 ps, respectively.\nA relativistic electron traverses the fringe field re-\ngion of length 2Din a timet trans ∼2D/c≈67 ps.\nSince the transit time is longer than the cyclotron period\n(ttrans ≈T c), the magnetic field experienced by the elec-\ntron changes slowly over a single cyclotron period. This\njustifies the use of the adiabatic approximation, where\nthe rate of change of the field is small compared to its\ncharacteristic frequency scales:\n\f\f\f\f\n∂ωc\n∂t\n\f\f\f\f ≪ ωc\nTc\n∼ω 2\nc .(C1)\nUnder this condition, we can show that an approxi-\nmate solution to the Schr¨ odinger equation (1) remains\nan NSLG state (3), but with a time-dependent cyclotron\nfrequency. This follows from the analysis of the equa-\ntions for the optical functions, which retain their form\nwith the magnetic length now being a function of time:\nσL →σ L (t) =\np\n2ℏc/|eH(t)|.\nTo simplify the calculation, we model the change in the\ncyclotron frequency across the transition region as lin-\near, i.e.,ω c(t)≈ω ′\nct, where the constant rate of change\nisω ′\nc ≈ω c/ttrans. Then, we repeat the derivation from\n[12], substituting this time-dependent frequency into the\nsystem of optical equations [23] in that paper.

INTRODUCTION\nUltrarelativistic heavy-ion collision (uRHIC) experiments, carried out at the Relativistic\nHeavy Ion Collider (RHIC) and the Large Hadron Collider (LHC), have been instrumental in\ncreating and studying the QGP , a state of matter where quarks and gluons are deconfined [1–\n4]. The asymmetric initial geometry in non-central collisions and rapid expansion of the QGP\nlead to anisotropic pressure gradients, and the momentum distribution of emitted particles\nbecomes anisotropic in the local rest frame [ 5, 6]. In particular, the medium expands more\nalong one direction than others, leading to unequal pressures (and particle yields) in different\nazimuthal directions, and this anisotropy may persist through much of the QGP’s evolution\n[7]. This anisotropy is reflected in the momentum distribution of produced particles and\nquantified using F ourier coeﬀicients vn of the azimuthal distribution of emitted particles.\nThe second harmonic (elliptic flow v2) and third harmonic (triangular flow v3) have been\nmeasured extensively at RHIC and LHC, providing direct evidence of anisotropic collective\nexpansion [8]. This indicates that the QGP , behaving nearly as an ideal fluid, retains memory\nof the initial geometry through much of its evolution.\nMomentum anisotropy is expected to influence the thermodynamic and transport prop-\nerties of QCD matter, especially at finite temperature and non-zero chemical potentials.\nWhile lattice QCD (LQCD) calculations indicate that the transition from QGP to hadrons\nis a smooth crossover at low baryon density [9–15], the notorious sign problem limits LQCD\nat high density [ 16], so one must rely on QCD low-energy effective models to explore this\nregime. In the literature, these models are widely used to explore the phase structure of\ndense matter, and they generally predict the existence of a first-order chiral phase tran-\nsition terminating in a critical end point (CEP) [ 17–22]. Experimental facilities such as\nNICA at JINR (Russia) [ 23], F AIR at GSI (Germany), including its CBM [24] and P ANDA\n[25] experiments, as well as J-P ARC (Japan) [ 26], aim to provide critical insights into the\nproperties of QCD matter at high baryon densities. Effective models provide a controlled\nframework to include essential QCD features such as spontaneous chiral symmetry break-\ning and confinement. These include the quark-meson coupling (QMC) model [ 27, 28], the\nPolyakov-loop extended QMC (PQMC) model [ 29], the Nambu-Jona-Lasinio (NJL) model\n[30, 31], the Polyakov NJL (PNJL) model [ 32, 33], the linear sigma model (LSM) [ 34], its\n2Polyakov extended version PLSM [ 35], the chiral SU(3) quark mean field model (CQMF)\n[36], and Polyakov CQMF (PCQMF) model [ 37]. In addition, other approaches such as the\nfunctional renormalization group approach [38, 39] and Dyson-Schwinger equation approach\n[40] have also been proposed to probe the behaviour of QCD at finite chemical potentials.\nThese models have been widely applied to investigate the thermodynamic [41] and transport\nproperties [ 42, 43] of strongly interacting matter.\nRecent model developments account for effects such as strong magnetic and electric fields\n[44–51], finite volume [52–58], non-extensivity [59, 60], and vorticity [61, 62] to faithfully cap-\nture the complexity of the QCD matter produced in uRHIC. Conventionally , these models\nhave relied on the assumption that quark matter remains perfectly isotropic in momentum\nspace in the absence of magnetic fields. However, realistic QGP is inherently anisotropic\ndue to initial geometric asymmetry and unequal expansion dynamics along the longitudinal\n(beam) and transverse directions of the medium. Initial spatial anisotropy causes signif-\nicantly lower pressure along the longitudinal direction, resulting in faster expansion and\ncooling along the beam direction [ 7]. As a result, the transverse momenta of particles dom-\ninate significantly over longitudinal momenta, making the parton momentum distributions\nanisotropic [ 63]. Hydrodynamic and AdS/CFT analyses, as well as classical Y ang–Mills\nsimulations within the color-glass-condensate framework [5, 64–66], all indicate that the mo-\nmentum anisotropy persists for at least τ ≲ 2 fm/c, with pressure ratios PL/PT well below\nunity . These results show that a realistic phenomenological analysis of strongly interacting\nmatter must incorporate momentum anisotropy .\nThe anisotropic momentum distributions not only modifies the local properties of the\nQGP but also induces chromo-W eibel instabilities associated with color collective modes,\ndriving rapid redistribution of energy and momentum, thereby shaping the QGP’s early-\ntime evolution and subsequent hydrodynamic behavior [ 67–70]. In practice, momentum\nanisotropy is typically modelled by a parameter ξ, which encodes the degree of deformation\nalong a specified direction, effectively quantifying the extent to which the distribution is\nstretched or compressed relative to isotropy . This approach, first developed by Romatschke\nand Strickland [7], has since become a central tool in kinetic and hydrodynamic treatments\nof anisotropic QGP . Numerous studies have explored how momentum anisotropy alters key\nobservables, from photon and dilepton yields [ 71–73] to parton self-energies [ 74, 75], heavy-\n3quark potentials [76–78], quarkonium states [79–81], jet-quenching coeﬀicients [82], and fun-\ndamental transport coeﬀicients [ 83, 84], as well as non-equilibrium hydrodynamic behavior\n[85].\nMomentum anisotropy can significantly modify the equation of state and the transport\nproperties of the QGP . T ransport coeﬀicients, such as shear viscosityη, bulk viscosity ζb, and\nelectrical conductivity σel, which govern the QGP’s response to gradients and external fields,\nare known to be particularly sensitive to anisotropic effects. Recent studies have explored\nthese effects on QCD matter using various effective models. F or instance, a 2+1 flavor quark-\nmeson (QM) model showed that increasing the anisotropy parameter, ξ, suppresses ηand σel\nand leads to a nontrivial behavior inζb [86]. A similar reduction in viscosity and conductivity\nwas confirmed using a quasiparticle relaxation time approximation (R T A) to the Boltzmann\nequation [ 87]. Within the PNJL model, Ref. [ 84] found that anisotropy amplified baryon-\nnumber fluctuations, enhancing kurtosis, skewness, and deforming isentropic trajectories.\nRef. [ 83] showed that σel increases with temperature but is suppressed by anisotropy in a\nquasiparticle R T A setup. In a three-flavor PQM analysis impact of finite anisotropy on nature\nof phase transition has been explored in Ref. [ 88]. The above various studies underscore\nthe importance of incorporating momentum-space anisotropy for accurately describing the\nthermodynamic properties and transport coeﬀicients of QCD matter.\nMotivated by this, we aim to examine the influence of momentum anisotropy on the ther-\nmodynamic observables and transport coeﬀicients of strongly interacting matter within the\nPolyakov chiral SU(3) quark mean field (PCQMF) model, across a wide range of temper-\natures and chemical potentials relevant to heavy-ion collisions. The PCQMF model is an\neffective framework that incorporates both chiral and deconfinement dynamics by including\nPolyakov loop variables in a three-flavor chiral mean field model. It contains quark inter-\nactions with scalar and vector meson fields, which drive chiral symmetry breaking and its\nrestoration, along with a Polyakov loop potential that effectively captures gluon dynamics\nfor confinement. This approach effectively reproduces QCD thermodynamics across a range\nof temperatures and chemical potentials [ 89]. It has been used to study the fluctuations of\nconserved charges [90], nonextensive [91], finite-volume effects [92], and properties of nuclear\nas well as quark stars [93, 94]. The momentum-space anisotropy is incorporated via a dimen-\nsionless parameter ξ, which quantifies the extent of deformation along a specific direction,\n4thereby capturing deviations from local isotropy in the medium. Employing the anisotropic\nPCQMF framework, we compute key thermodynamic quantities, including pressure, energy\ndensity , entropy density , speed of sound, and specific heat. W e then calculate transport co-\neﬀicients, such as shear viscosity , bulk viscosity , and electrical conductivity , by solving the\nrelativistic Boltzmann equation (RBE) within the R T A under anisotropic conditions. W e as-\nsume an isotropic relaxation time τ, following standard practice, and discuss the implications\nand limitations of this assumption in the section II C. It should be noted that implementing\nanisotropy affects only the momentum dependence within distribution functions and does\nnot introduce new fundamental interactions. Additionally , we restrict ourselves to a weakly\nanisotropic medium, i.e., |ξ| <1, allowing us to expand the anisotropic distribution function\nlinearly around its isotropic equilibrium form. This enables us to decompose the transport\ncoeﬀicients explicitly into isotropic contributions and anisotropic corrections [ 83].\nThe remainder of this paper is structured as follows. In Sec. II A, we outline the theo-\nretical framework of the PCQMF model. The incorporation of momentum-space anisotropy\ninto the PCQMF model is presented in Sec. II B. Anisotropic expressions of the transport\ncoeﬀicients are derived in Sec. II C. In Sec. III, we examine the influence of momentum\nanisotropy on the thermodynamic and transport properties of the medium, with compar-\nisons to available lattice QCD results. Finally , Sec. IV summarizes our findings and offers\nphysical interpretations of the observed effects.\nII. METHODOLOGY\nIn this section, we detail the theoretical framework employed to investigate the impact\nof momentum anisotropy on the thermodynamic and transport properties of quark matter\nand its implications on the QCD phase diagram. W e begin with an overview of the PCQMF\nmodel. Then, we outline the procedure for incorporating momentum anisotropy into the\nmodel and derive the anisotropic expressions for shear viscosity , bulk viscosity , and electrical\nconductivity by employing the RBE within R T A.\n5A. The PCQMF Model\nThe PCQMF model is an effective QCD-based framework that incorporates key non-\nperturbative aspects of QCD, specifically , spontaneous breaking of chiral symmetry and\nquark confinement, within a thermodynamically consistent mean-field approximation [ 37].\nThe Lagrangian density is expressed as\nLPCQMF = Lchiral − U(Φ,¯Φ,T). (1)\nHere, the term Lchiral contains the interactions between quarks and mesonic fields, along with\nself-interaction terms that govern spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking and its subsequent\nrestoration at finite temperature and density . The quantity U(Φ,¯Φ,T) denotes the effective\nPolyakov loop potential, which encodes the deconfinement transition dynamics via the traced\nPolyakov loop variable Φ and its conjugate ¯Φ. The chiral Lagrangian is decomposed as [ 95]\nLchiral = Lq0 + Lqm + LM + L∆m, (2)\nwhere Lq0 = ¯ψ(iγµ∂µ)ψ describes the kinetic part of the free quark fields ψ = ( u,d,s ). The\nquark-meson interactions are incorporated by the term Lqm which is given by\nLqm = gs\n(¯ψLMψR + ¯ψRM+ψL\n)\n− gv\n(¯ψLγµlµψL + ¯ψRγµrµψR\n)\n, (3)\nwhere gs and gv denote the scalar and vector coupling constants, respectively , determin-\ning the strength of the quark interactions with the corresponding mesonic fields. The\nscalar(pseudoscalar) and vector(axial-vector) meson nonets are defined as M(M+) =\n1√\n2\n∑8\na=0(σa ± iπa)λa and lµ(rµ) = 1\n2\n√\n2\n∑8\na=0(va\nµ ± ra\nµ)λa, respectively , with λa being\nthe Gell-Mann matrices. The dynamics of the meson sector are described by the term\nLM = LΣΣ + LV V + LSB . The first term LΣΣ, details the self-interactions of the scalar\nmesons and is written as\nLΣΣ = −1\n2 k0χ2 (σ2 + ζ2 + δ2) + k1 (σ2 + ζ2 + δ2)2\n+k2\n(\nσ4\n2 + δ4\n2 + 3σ2δ2 + ζ4\n)\n+ k3χ(σ2 − δ2) ζ− k4χ4\n−1\n4 χ4lnχ4\nχ4\n0\n+ d\n3 χ4ln\n((\n(σ2−δ2)ζ\nσ2\n0ζ0\n)(\nχ3\nχ3\n0\n))\n, (4)\n6which includes the scalar dilaton (glueball) field χto incorporate the broken scale invariance\n[96, 97]. The second term, LV V , accounts for the self-interactions among vector mesons\nLV V = 1\n2\nχ2\nχ2\n0\n(m2\nωω2 + m2\nρρ2 + m2\nϕϕ2) + g4(ω4 + 6ω2ρ2 + ρ4 + 2ϕ4). (5)\nLastly , the termLSB is included to explicitly break the chiral symmetry in the model, thereby\nproviding mass to the pseudoscalar mesons. This term is defined as\nLSB = −χ2\nχ2\n0\n(hxσ+ hyζ) , (6)\nwith hx = m2\nπfπ and hy = (\n√\n2m2\nKfK − 1√\n2 m2\nπfπ). An additional term, L∆m = −∆ms ¯ψSψ,\nis introduced in Eq. ( 2) to fine tune the strange quark mass, with ∆ms = 29 Me V and\nS = 1\n3\n(\nI− λ8\n√\n3\n)\n= diag(0 ,0,1). Within the mean-field approximation, the meson fields\nare replaced by their expectation values. The scalar fields: non-strange σ, strange ζ, and\nthe isovector scalar δ fields (for isospin asymmetric matter) and the vector fields: ωµ →\nωδµ0, ρµa → ρδµ0δa3, and, ϕµ → ϕδµ0 have nonzero expectation values. The parameters\nof Lagrangian ( k0,k1,...) and the quark-meson couplings ( gs,gv), are fixed by requiring the\nmodel to reproduce key properties of QCD in the vacuum. These constraints include the\nmasses of low-lying scalar and pseudoscalar mesons ( π,K,σ,η,η\n′\n) in vacuum.

( 1) takes the standard logarithmic\nform [98]\nU(Φ,¯Φ,T)\nT4 = −a(T)\n2\n¯ΦΦ + b(T)ln\n[\n1 − 6¯ΦΦ + 4( ¯Φ3 + Φ3) − 3(¯ΦΦ)2]\n, (7)\nwhere the temperature dependent parameters a(T) and b(T) are given by\na(T) = a0 + a1\n(T0\nT\n)\n+ a2\n(T0\nT\n)2\n, b(T) = b3\n(T0\nT\n)3\n. (8)\n7The parameters a0 = 1 .81, a1 = −2.47, a2 = 15 .2, and b3 = −1.75 are determined to repro-\nduce thermodynamic results from pure gauge lattice QCD simulations [ 99]. The parameter\nT0 represents the critical temperature and in the pure gauge sector is typically ∼ 270 Me V\n[100]. However, when fermions are included, its value depends on the number of quark flavors\nNf [101]. Additionally , the presence of these dynamical quarks influences the gluons that\nshape the effective Polyakov loop potential (quark backreaction). T o account for dynamical\nquark effects on the Polyakov loop, an effective glue potential is introduced [ 102], with the\nmapping between glue and pure gauge temperatures defined as\nTY M − TY M\n0\nTY M\n0\n= 0 .57Tglue − Tglue\n0\nTglue\n0\n, Uglue(Φ,¯Φ,Tglue)\nT4\nglue\n= UY M (Φ,¯Φ,TY M )\nT4\nY M\n, (9)\nwhere Tglue is identified with the system temperature T, and TY M\n0 = Tglue\n0 = 200 Me V, in\nthis work.\nIn the mean field approximation, the thermodynamic potential per unit volume in a grand\ncanonical ensemble at a given temperature T and chemical potential µ takes the form [ 92]\nΩPCQMF = Ω q¯q + Ωvac + U(Φ,¯Φ,T) − LM − Vvac, (10)\nwhere Ωq¯q comprises of quark and antiquark thermal contribution and is written as\nΩq¯q =\n∑\ni=u,d,s\n−γiT\n(2π)3\n∫\nd3k\n{\nlnF−\ni (k) + ln F+\ni (k)\n}\n, (11)\nwith\nF−\ni (k) = 1 + e−3E−\ni (k) + 3Φe−E−\ni (k) + 3 ¯Φe−2E−\ni (k), (12)\nF+\ni (k) = 1 + e−3E+\ni (k) + 3 ¯Φe−E+\ni (k) + 3Φe−2E+\ni (k), (13)\nand γi = 2 is the spin degeneracy . The dimensionless energies are defined as E±\ni (k) =\n(E∗\ni (k) ± µi∗)/T with E∗\ni (k) =\n√\nk2 + m∗2\ni being the effective energy of a quark of flavor i\nand m∗\ni being the effective quark mass generated dynamically through its coupling to the\nscalar fields and is given as\nmi\n∗ = −gi\nσσ− gi\nζζ− gi\nδδ+ ∆mi, (14)\nwhere gi\nσ,ζ,δ are the respective scalar coupling constants and ∆mu,d = 0 . Similarly , the\neffective chemical potential µ∗\ni is shifted from its vacuum value µi and is defined in terms of\n8vector fields through relation\nµi\n∗ = µi − gi\nωω− gi\nϕϕ− gi\nρρ. (15)\nThe vector coupling constants gi\nω,ϕ,ρ determine the strength of the repulsive vector in-\nteractions. F or asymmetric quark matter, the quark chemical potentials are related to\nthe baryon µB, isospin µI, and strangeness µS chemical potentials through the relations\nµB = 3\n2 (µu + µd),µI = 1\n2 (µu − µd), and µS = 1\n2 (µu + µd − 2µs). The fermionic vacuum term,\nΩvac, in Eq. ( 10) is given by\nΩvac = −2Nc\n∑\ni=u,d,s\n∫ d3k\n(2π)3 E∗\ni (k). (16)\nThis integral is divergent and regularized using dimensional regularization as [ 103]\nΩvac = − Nc\n(8π2)\n∑\ni=u,d,s\nm∗2\ni ln\n(m∗\ni\nΛ0\n)\n, (17)\nwhere Λ0 = 600 Me V is the regularization scale parameter. A constant, Vvac in Eq. ( 10) is\nsubtracted to ensure zero vacuum energy . The temperature dependence of the scalar, vector,\nand Polyakov fields is determined by solving the coupled equations of motion obtained by\nminimizing ΩPCQMF with respect to each field. The scalar density ρs\ni and the vector density\nρi for each quark flavor are then calculated as\nρs\ni = γiNc\n∫ d3k\n(2π)3\nm∗\ni\nE∗\ni (k)\n(\nfi(k) + ¯fi(k)\n)\n, (18)\nρi = γiNc\n∫ d3k\n(2π)3\n(\nfi(k) − ¯fi(k)\n)\n, (19)\nrespectively . The equilibrium distribution functions for quarks fi(k) and antiquarks ¯fi(k),\nwhich include the effects of the Polyakov loop, are given by [ 89]\nfi(k) = Φe−E−\ni (k) + 2 ¯Φe−2E−\ni (k) + e−3E−\ni (k)\n[1 + 3Φ e−E−\ni (k) + 3 ¯Φe−2E−\ni (k) + e−3E−\ni (k)]\n, (20)\n¯fi(k) =\n¯Φe−E+\ni (k) + 2Φe−2E+\ni (k) + e−3E+\ni (k)\n[1 + 3 ¯Φe−E+(k)\ni + 3Φe−2E+\ni (k) + e−3E+\ni (k)]\n. (21)\n9B. Incorporation of Momentum-Space Anisotropy\nT o phenomenologically account for the effects of local momentum-space anisotropy , we\nfollow the spheroidal momentum deformation proposed by Romatschke and Strickland [ 7].\nThis approach is characterized by rescaling momentum in a preferred direction and intro-\nducing a dimensionless anisotropy parameter, ξ, which is defined based on the components\nof momentum parallel ( p∥) and perpendicular ( p⊥) to the direction of anisotropy ( ˆn) as\nξ = ⟨p2\n⊥⟩\n2⟨p2\n∥⟩ − 1, (22)\nwith −1 < ξ < ∞. The parameter ξ has a value of −1 before the collision when the\nwhole of the system’s momentum is along the longitudinal direction, implying a maximally\nstretched distribution along the direction of anisotropy . F or values of −1 < ξ <0, the\nparticle distribution is stretched along the anisotropy direction, while ξ >0 indicates the\nparticle distribution is squeezed (contracted) along that direction. ξ = 0 corresponds to an\nisotropic momentum distribution while ξ = ∞ implies that all particles are moving along\nthe transverse direction or maximally squeezed along the anisotropy direction.\nF or a given anisotropy direction ˆn, the quark momentum, k, is modified to ˜k\n˜k2 = k2 + ξ(k · ˆn)2, (23)\nwhich in turn modifies the effective single-particle energy of a quark of flavor i to\nE∗\ni,aniso(k) =\n√\n˜k2 + m2\ni =\n√\nE∗2\ni (k) + ξk2 cos2 θ, (24)\nwhere θ is the angle between k and the anisotropy axis. F or a weakly anisotropic medium\nwhere |ξ| <1, we expand this energy to linear order in ξ as\nE∗\ni,aniso(k) ≈ E∗\ni (k) + ξ\n(k2cos2θ\n2E∗\ni (k)\n)\n. (25)\nThis change to the effective energy propagates to the dimensionless energies E±(k) =\n(E∗\ni (k) ±µ∗\ni )/T that appear in the thermodynamic potential. The anisotropic dimensionless\nenergy can thus be written as\nE±\ni,aniso(k) = E±\ni (k) + δE, (26)\n10where the dimensionless correction, δE, is given by\nδE = ξ\n(k2cos2θ\n2E∗\ni (k)T\n)\n. (27)\nThus, introducing momentum anisotropy into the system leads to the single particle ef-\nfective energy to become direction dependent. In particular, particles moving closer to the\nanisotropic direction (typically the beam axis in uRHIC) acquire an additional contribution\nto their energy proportional to cos2θ. This directional deformation of the effective energy\ninduces anisotropic modification in the thermodynamic potential density of the PCQMF\nmodel. This results in anisotropic corrections to the thermodynamic and transport prop-\nerties. The anisotropic functions are obtained by substituting E±\ni,aniso(k) for E±\ni (k) in their\nexpressions. F or any function g(E±\ni (k)) that depends on the dimensionless quark energy , its\nanisotropic counterpart g(E±\ni,aniso(k)), can be approximated to linear order in ξ as\ng(E±\ni,aniso(k)) ≈ g(E±\ni (k)) + ∂g(E±\ni (k))\n∂E±\ni (k) δE. (28)\nW e apply this linear expansion to the quark-antiquark contribution in the thermodynamic\npotential, Ωq¯q, gets modified as\nΩq¯q,aniso =\n∑\ni=u,d,s\n−γiT\n(2π)3\n∫\nd3k\n{\nlnF−\ni,aniso(k) + ln F+\ni,aniso(k)\n}\n. (29)\nUsing Eq. ( 28) for lnF±\ni,aniso(k), the Eq. ( 29) can be written as\nΩq¯q,aniso = Ω q¯q + ξ\n( ∑\ni=u,d,s\nγiNc\n12π2E∗\ni (k)\n∫\nk4dk[fi(k) + ¯fi(k)]\n)\n. (30)\nSimilarly , the anisotropic scalar and vector densities can be identified by differentiating the\nabove equation with respect to σ and ω, respectively , as\nρs\ni,aniso = ρs\ni − ξ\n( γiNc\n12π2T\n∫\nk4dk m∗\ni\nE∗2\ni (k) [Ai(k) + Bi(k)]\n)\n, (31)\nρi,aniso = ρi + ξ\n( γiNc\n12π2T\n∫ k4dk\nE∗\ni (k) [Ai(k) − Bi(k)]\n)\n, (32)\nwhere the terms\nAi(k) =\n(\nΦe−E−\ni (k) + 4 ¯Φe−2E−\ni (k) + 3e−3E−\ni (k)\n)\n− 3fi(k)\n(\nΦe−E−\ni (k) + 2 ¯Φe−2E−\ni (k) + e−3E−\ni (k)\n)\nF−\ni (k)\n(33)\n11and\nBi(k) =\n(\n¯Φe−E+\ni (k) + 4Φe−2E+\ni (k) + 3e−3E+\ni (k)\n)\n− 3 ¯fi(k)\n(\n¯Φe−E+\ni (k) + 2Φe−2E+\ni (k) + e−3E+\ni (k)\n)\nF+\ni (k) .\n(34)\nThe anisotropic distribution functions, fi,aniso(k) and ¯fi,aniso(k) are then approximated as\nfi,aniso(k) ≈ fi(k) +\n( ∂fi(k)\n∂E−\ni (k)\n)\nδE ≡ fi(k) + δfi(k), (35)\n¯fi,aniso(k) ≈ ¯fi(k) +\n( ∂¯fi(k)\n∂E+\ni (k)\n)\nδE ≡ ¯fi(k) + δ¯fi(k), (36)\nwhich can be split into isotropic and anisotropic parts as\nfi,aniso(k) = fi(k) − ξ\n(k2cos2θ\n2E∗\ni (k)T [fi(k)(1 − 3fi(k)) + Xi(k)]\n)\n, (37)\n¯fi,aniso(k) = ¯fi(k) − ξ\n(k2cos2θ\n2E∗\ni (k)T\n[¯fi(k)(1 − 3 ¯fi(k)) + Yi(k)\n])\n, (38)\nwith\nXi(k) =\n2\n(\n¯Φe−2E−\ni (k) + e−3E−\ni (k)\n)\nF−\ni (k) , Y i(k) =\n2\n(\nΦe−2E+\ni (k) + e−3E+\ni (k)\n)\nF+\ni (k) . (39)\nC. T ransport coeﬀicients in anisotropic PCQMF model\nThe transport coeﬀicients can be derived from the RBE, which describes the evolution of\nthe single particle distribution function in phase space. F or systems close to the equilibrium\nin presence of external field, one can use the R T A to simplify the complex collision term,\nand the RBE is then written as [ 104]\nkµ∂µf(x,k) + qFαβkβ\n∂\n∂kα f(x,k) = C[f(x,k)] = −kµuµ\nτ (f(x,k) − f0(x,k)) = −kµuµ\nτ δf,\n(40)\nwhere q is the charge of a quark and Fαβ represent the electromagnetic field strength tensor.\nThe term uµ is the fluid four-velocity , τ is the relaxation time for the particle species, and\nδf = f(x,k) − f0(x,k) is the deviation from the local equilibrium distribution f0(x,k) given\nin Eq. ( 20). The relaxation time τ is given by [ 105]\nτ = 1\n5.1Tα2\nSln(1/αS)(1 + 0 .12(2Nf + 1)) , (41)\n12where αs(T,µ) is the standard two-loop running coupling written as [ 106, 107]\nαS(T,µ) = 6π\n(33 − 2Nf )ln\n(\nT\nΛT\n√\n1 + ( µ\nπT )2\n)\n\n1 − 3(153 − 19Nf )\n(33 − 2Nf )2\nln\n(\n2ln T\nΛT\n√\n1 + ( µ\nπT )2\n)\nln\n(\nT\nΛT\n√\n1 + ( µ\nπT )2\n)\n\n,\n(42)\nwith ΛT being the QCD scale-fixing parameter originating from the lowest nonzero Matsub-\nara modes [ 108] and is fixed at ΛT = 70 Me V [107]. W e assume τ to remain isotropic even\nin the presence of momentum anisotropy in the distribution functions. This is a simplifying\napproximation that allows us to isolate the direct effect of the anisotropic particle distri-\nbution on the transport coeﬀicients. While a fully self-consistent treatment would involve\nan anisotropic relaxation time, this approach is standard in many initial phenomenological\nstudies [83, 86, 87].\nThe transport coeﬀicients quantify the linear response of a system to small gradients\nor external fields. They are extracted from the dissipative parts of the energy-momentum\ntensor Tµν and conserved current densities such as electric currentJµ. The general procedure\ninvolves measuring small perturbations in the local equilibrium distribution function f0 as\nδf = f − f0 using the RBE within R T A, in the presence of appropriate gradients, e.g.,\nvelocity gradient for shear and bulk viscosities, or electric field for conductivity . δf is then\nsubstituted into the expressions of Tµν or Jµ, and the transport coeﬀicients quantify the\nlinear response of a system by relating dissipative fluxes to their associated thermodynamic\ngradients. The detailed derivations can be found in Refs. [ 105, 109, 110].

The anisotropic terms are pro-\nportional to ξ and introduce angular integrals (involving cos2θ) which result in enhancing\nor suppressing contributions from longitudinal modes, depending on the sign of ξ. Although\nthe overall form of the integrals remains similar to the isotropic case, the anisotropic compo-\nnents carry higher powers of momentum, encoding their sensitivity to directional flow and\ngradients in the medium. This decomposition of transport coeﬀicients into isotropic and\nanisotropic parts enables their systematic numerical analysis.\nIII. RESUL TS\nIn this section, we present and discuss the impact of momentum-space anisotropy , char-\nacterized by the parameter ξ, on the chiral and deconfinement order parameters, various\nthermodynamic observables, and key transport coeﬀicients of strongly interacting QCD mat-\nter within the PCQMF model. The analysis is performed for two distinct scenarios: one at\nvanishing baryon chemical potential ( µB = 0 Me V) and another at a finite baryon chemical\npotential ( µB = 400 Me V). The results are presented for different values of the anisotropy\nparameter: the isotropic case ξ = 0 .0, oblate (squeezed) distributions with ξ = 0 .2 and\nξ = 0 .4, and a prolate (stretched) case with ξ = −0.2.\nW e begin by examining the effect of momentum anisotropy on the effective quark masses,\nwhich are directly linked to the chiral dynamics of the system. Fig. 1 shows the effective\nquark masses m∗\nu, m∗\nd, and m∗\ns as a function of temperature T. The left panels [(a), (c),\n(e)] correspond to µB = 0 Me V, while the right panels [(b), (d), (f)] are for a system at\nµB = 400 Me V,µI = −30 Me V, andµS = 125 Me V. F or the isotropic case (ξ = 0 ), all quark\nmasses exhibit a significant reduction with increasing temperature, reflecting the gradual\nrestoration of chiral symmetry . When anisotropy is introduced, this behavior is modified.\nF or positive values ofξ(oblate), the quark masses decrease slowly , suggesting that a squeezed\nmomentum distribution delays chiral symmetry restoration. Conversely , a negative value ofξ\n(prolate) results in a faster decrease of the quark masses, indicating that the chiral transition\nis triggered earlier. This behavior can be understood from the modification of single-particle\nenergy due to anisotropy . An oblate distribution enhances the effective thermal energy of\n15(a)\n100 150 200 250 300\nT (MeV)\n0\n50\n100\n150\n200\n250\n300\n350\nmu\n*  (MeV)\nB = 0 MeV\n = 0.0\n = 0.2\n = 0.4\n= -0.2 (b)\n100 150 200 250 300\nT (MeV)\n0\n50\n100\n150\n200\n250\n300\n350\nmu\n*  (MeV)\nB = 400 MeV\n = 0.0\n = 0.2\n = 0.4\n= -0.2\n(c)\n100 150 200 250 300\nT (MeV)\n0\n50\n100\n150\n200\n250\n300\n350\nmd\n*  (MeV)\nB = 0 MeV\n = 0.0\n = 0.2\n = 0.4\n= -0.2 (d)\n100 150 200 250 300\nT (MeV)\n0\n50\n100\n150\n200\n250\n300\n350\nmd\n*  (MeV)\nB = 400 MeV\n = 0.0\n = 0.2\n = 0.4\n= -0.2\n(e)\n100 150 200 250 300\nT (MeV)\n150\n200\n250\n300\n350\n400\n450\n500\nms\n*  (MeV)\nB = 0 MeV\n = 0.0\n = 0.2\n = 0.4\n= -0.2 (f)\n100 150 200 250 300\nT (MeV)\n150\n200\n250\n300\n350\n400\n450\n500\nms\n*  (MeV)\nB = 400 MeV\n = 0.0\n = 0.2\n = 0.4\n= -0.2\nFIG. 1.

The Polyakov fields Φ and ¯Φ are plotted as a function of temperature T for anisotropy\nparameter ξ = 0, 0.2, 0.4, and −0.2, at baryon chemical potential µB = 0 Me V [in subplots (a) and\n(c)], and baryon chemical potential µB = 400 Me V, isospin chemical potentialµI = −30 Me V, and\nstrangeness chemical potential µS = 125 Me V [in subplots (b) and (d)].\nNext, we investigate the temperature dependence of Polyakov loop fields, Φ and ¯Φ for\nvarious values of ξ at µB = 0 Me V [(a), (c)] and µB = 400 Me V [(b), (d)] in Fig. 2. In\nthe isotropic case, both Φ and ¯Φ transition from values close to zero in the low-temperature\n(confined) phase to values approaching unity in the high-temperature (deconfined) phase.\nA positive ξ leads to a slight suppression of Φ and ¯Φ at intermediate temperatures, while\na negative ξ causes a minor enhancement. This may indicate that the deconfinement of\nquarks gets delayed for a system with a squeezed momentum distribution compared to the\nisotropic case. Increasing the baryon chemical potential to µB = 400 Me V leads to unequal\nenhancement in Φ and ¯Φ at lower temperatures. The effect of ξ is similar to the case of zero\nchemical potential.\n17T o more precisely quantify the chiral phase transition, we compute the subtracted chiral\ncondensate, ∆l,s, defined as [ 114]\n∆l,s(T) =\n⟨ ¯ψψ⟩l,T − ˆml\nˆms\n⟨ ¯ψψ⟩s,T\n⟨ ¯ψψ⟩l,0 − ˆml\nˆms\n⟨ ¯ψψ⟩s,0\n, (55)\nwhere ˆml and ˆms denote the bare masses of light and strange quarks, respectively , and are\ndirectly related to the symmetry breaking parameters hx and hy appearing in Eq. ( 6) [21].\nAdditionally , in the context of the PCQMF model, the light quark condensate ⟨ ¯ψψ⟩l,T and\nstrange quark condensate ⟨ ¯ψψ⟩s,T can be replaced with the non-strange σand strange ζ field,\nrespectively . As a result, we can write the subtracted chiral condensate as\n∆l,s(T) =\nσ− hx\nhy\nζ\nσ0 − hx\nhy\nζ0\n, (56)\nwhere σ0 and ζ0 denote the vacuum values of the scalar fields. This observable provides a\nclear signal for the chiral crossover. In Fig. 3, we plot ∆l,s as a function of temperature\nat various values of ξ. The left panel shows the results at µB = 0 Me V, which are in good\nqualitative agreement with lattice QCD data from Ref. [ 115]. Positive values of ξ shift the\ntransition curve to higher temperatures, while a negative ξ shifts it to lower temperatures.\nThis confirms that a prolate momentum distribution promotes an earlier chiral transition,\nwhereas an oblate distribution delays it. At µB = 400 Me V (right panel), the transition\ntemperature is lowered, as expected, and the separation between the curves for different ξ\nvalues remains significant, highlighting the persistent role of anisotropy at finite density .\nThe impact of momentum anisotropy on the bulk thermodynamic properties of the quark\nmatter is presented in Fig. 4. Here, we plot the scaled pressure p/T4, scaled energy density\nϵ/T4, and scaled entropy density s/T3 as functions of temperature. The left panels [(a), (c),\n(e)] at µB = 0 are compared with lattice data. F or all cases, these quantities remain small\nin the confined phase and rise with temperature, finally approaching the Stefan-Boltzmann\n(SB) limit at very highT. Our results are in good qualitative agreement with the lattice data.\nA key finding is that the equation of state is directly modified by momentum anisotropy .\nPositive ξ values lead to a suppression in pressure, energy density , and entropy density at\na given temperature, while negative ξ values lead to their enhancement. This implies that\na system with a stretched momentum distribution is thermodynamically more active than\nan isotropic one.

At µB = 0 (top row), the speed of sound exhibits a characteristic\ndip near the transition temperature. The location and depth of this minimum are sensitive\nto anisotropy . A positive ξ makes the dip deeper and shifts it towards higher temperatures.\nIn contrast, a negative ξ shifts the dip to lower temperatures, consistent with the observed\nchange in the chiral transition. The specific heat displays a corresponding peak in the\ntransition region, which shifts to lower magnitude for positive ξ and grows for negative ξ.\nOur results for both quantities at zero chemical potential are in qualitative agreement with\navailable lattice data [12, 14]. At µB = 400 Me V (bottom row), these features are shifted to\nlower temperatures, with the softening of the equation of state being particularly evident.\nW e now turn to the transport properties of the anisotropic quark matter. Fig. 6 presents\nthe specific shear viscosity ,ηaniso/s, and the normalized bulk viscosity , ζb,aniso/sas functions\nof temperature, for various ξ. Shear viscosity characterizes a fluid’s resistance to shear stress,\nessentially its internal friction.

Momentum anisotropy has a significant impact; a positive ξ (squeezed)\ndecreases ηaniso/s, making the fluid less viscous and pushing the system even closer to the\nperfect fluid. This behavior is attributed to the growth of chromo-W eibel instabilities in\nthe anisotropically expanding plasma. These instabilities generate turbulent color fields\nthat provide a highly eﬀicient, non-collisional mechanism for momentum transport, thereby\nreducing the effective shear viscosity [87, 124]. In contrast, a negative ξ (stretched) increases\nηaniso/s, resulting in a more viscous fluid. Such a prolate momentum configuration is expected\nto arise in the presence of a strong magnetic field, which constrains the motion of charged\nquarks to the lowest Landau level along the field direction [125]. This is similar to the results\nobtained in the quasiparticle model approaches [ 83, 87], 2+1 flavor QM model [ 86], and two\n22(a)\n150 200 250 300\nT (MeV)\n0\n0.05\n0.1\n0.15\n0.2\n0.25\n0.3\n0.35el,aniso/T\nB = 0 MeV\n=0\n=0.2\n=0.4\n=-0.2\nlattice (b)\n150 200 250 300\nT (MeV)\n0\n0.05\n0.1\n0.15\n0.2\nel,aniso/T\nB = 400 MeV\n=0\n=0.2\n=0.4\n=-0.2\nFIG. 7.

At a finite baryon chemical potential of µB = 400 Me V (Fig. 6 (c)),\nthe overall magnitude of ηaniso/sincreases across the temperature range, indicating that the\nsystem becomes more viscous at higher densities. Similar observations were reported in Ref.\n[87]. The normalized bulk viscosity at µB = 0 Me V is plotted in Fig. 6 (b). This transport\ncoeﬀicient, which is a measure of the system’s deviation from conformal invariance [126, 127],\nis significant near the transition and diminishes at high temperatures, signaling the system’s\napproach to the conformal limit where bulk viscosity is expected to vanish [128]. Our results\nfor µB = 0 Me V (top row), which show a distinct peak in ζb,aniso/s in the transition region,\nare in good agreement with lattice calculations [ 129, 130]. The introduction of anisotropy\nhas a minimal effect on ζb,aniso/sbeyond the transition temperature. A squeezed momentum\ndistribution ξ >0 slightly suppresses it, while a stretched distribution ξ <0 enhances it\nnear the transition temperature. At higher temperatures, the effect of ξon ζb,aniso/sbecomes\nnegligible. As for the case of finite baryon chemical potential of µB = 400 Me V in Fig. 6\n(d), we find that the magnitude of ζb,aniso/s is substantially suppressed compared to the\nµB = 0 case, and the effects of anisotropy become even less significant. This reduction\nat finite density is consistent with the general expectation that the system moves closer to\nconformality at higher densities for a given temperature.\nThe effect of anisotropy on charge transport is examined via the normalized electrical\n23conductivity ,σel,aniso/T, which is shown as a function of temperature in Fig. 7. The electrical\nconductivity increases with temperature as charge-carrying quarks become deconfined and\nmore mobile. Our results for µB = 0 Me V (left panel) are in reasonable agreement with\nlattice data [ 131]. The effect of anisotropy on conductivity is similar to its impact on shear\nand bulk viscosity . A positive ξ (squeezed distribution), is found to suppress the electrical\nconductivity . This suppression becomes more significant as the anisotropy increases. This is\nconsistent with the findings of Ref. [125], where the authors argue that an oblate momentum\ndistribution hinders the transport of charge along the direction of the applied electric field.\nIn contrast, a negative ξ(stretched distribution) enhances the conductivity . This is similar to\nthe findings in the 2+1 flavor QM model [86], however contrasts the results in two flavor NJL\nmodel, where σel/T first increases as ξ increases at low temperatures, but as temperature\nrises further, the values of σel/T for different ξ eventually overlap [ 112]. At finite baryon\nchemical potential (right panel), the overall magnitude of the electrical conductivity is higher\nthan at µB = 0 . This is a direct consequence of the increased net charge carrier density (an\nexcess of quarks over antiquarks) at finite µB. Importantly , the relative effect of ξ remains\nthe same as in the vanishing chemical potential case. Similar findings were reported in\nquasiparticle model approaches in Refs. [ 83] and [ 87].\nFinally , in Fig. 8, we display the thermal dependence of two important quantities that\ncharacterize the dissipative nature of the medium: the specific sound channel, (ηaniso +\n3ζb,aniso/4)/s, and the ratio of bulk to shear viscosity , ζb,aniso/ηaniso, for various ξ values.\nThe behavior of the specific sound channel (left panel) is largely governed by the specific\nshear viscosity , as the bulk viscosity contribution is negligible in comparison across most\nof the temperature range, except in the vicinity of the transition region, as shown in Fig.\n6 (b) and (d). Consequently , the specific sound channel exhibits a minimum near Tc, and\nits dependence on ξ directly mirrors that of ηaniso/s. The bulk-to-shear ratio, ζb,aniso/ηaniso,\nprovides a measure of the interplay between bulk and shear viscous effects. This ratio\nexhibits a prominent peak in the transition region at µB = 0 Me V (Fig. 8(b)), indicating\nthat bulk viscosity is most significant during the phase transition.

SUMMAR Y\nIn this work, we have presented a comprehensive analysis of the impact of momentum-\nspace anisotropy on the thermodynamic equation of state, and transport properties of\nstrongly interacting quark matter. Employing the Polyakov chiral SU(3) quark mean field\n25(PCQMF) model, which captures both chiral symmetry dynamics and quark confinement\nthrough a Polyakov loop potential, we introduce anisotropy via a spheroidal deformation in\nthe momentum distribution, quantified by the parameter ξ. A system with a “squeezed” or\noblate momentum distribution (ξ >0) preferentially populates transverse momentum states,\ncharacteristic of the rapid longitudinal expansion in the early stages of heavy-ion collisions.\nWhile a “stretched” or prolate distribution (ξ <0) favors momenta along the anisotropy axis,\na scenario expected to arise in the presence of a strong magnetic field, with ξ =0 represent-\ning the isotropic case. Our investigation reveals that even weak anisotropy profoundly alters\nthe system’s characteristics. W e find that key thermodynamic observables like pressure,\nenergy density , entropy density , squared speed of sound, and specific heat are systemati-\ncally suppressed for squeezed systems ( ξ >0) and enhanced for stretched ones ( ξ <0) when\ncompared to the isotropic case at the same temperature. This demonstrates that the mo-\nmentum distribution fundamentally modifies the available phase space and thus alters the\nbulk thermodynamic properties and the equation of state of the medium.\nF urthermore, the transport coeﬀicients, calculated by solving the relativistic Boltzmann\nequation in the relaxation time approximation, exhibit a strong and systematic depen-\ndence on this anisotropy . The specific shear viscosity ( ηaniso/s) and electrical conductiv-\nity ( σel,aniso/T) are significantly suppressed for squeezed distributions ( ξ >0), pushing the\nsystem closer to the “perfect fluid” ideal and hindering charge transport, respectively . Con-\nversely , these coeﬀicients are enhanced for stretched distributions (ξ <0). The bulk viscosity\n(ζb,aniso/s) shows a similar, though less pronounced, trend, with its characteristic peak near\nthe phase transition shifting in temperature and magnitude according to the value of ξ. At\na finite baryon chemical potential of µB = 400 Me V, the absolute magnitudes ofηaniso/sand\nζb,aniso/schange, with shear viscosity increasing while bulk viscosity is suppressed. However,\nthe qualitative dependence on the sign of ξ remains the same. Collectively , these results un-\nderscore that momentum-space anisotropy is a crucial physical feature that fundamentally\nreshapes the properties of the quark-gluon plasma. Even when weak, it induces signifi-\ncant modifications in both thermodynamic and transport properties of the QCD medium.\nThe thermodynamic responses are suppressed for positive ξ. The transport coeﬀicients are\nmodified significantly with ξ, especially near the transition temperature, highlighting the\nanisotropic redistribution of microscopic transport. Its inclusion is therefore essential for\n26the realistic phenomenological modeling of the early-time, pre-equilibrium dynamics in ul-\ntrarelativistic heavy-ion collisions at facilities like RHIC, the LHC, F AIR, and NICA, and\nfor accurately bridging theoretical predictions with experimental data.\nV.

INTRODUCTION\nUltrarelativistic heavy-ion collision (uRHIC) experiments, carried out at the Relativistic\nHeavy Ion Collider (RHIC) and the Large Hadron Collider (LHC), have been instrumental in\ncreating and studying the QGP , a state of matter where quarks and gluons are deconfined [1–\n4]. The asymmetric initial geometry in non-central collisions and rapid expansion of the QGP\nlead to anisotropic pressure gradients, and the momentum distribution of emitted particles\nbecomes anisotropic in the local rest frame [ 5, 6]. In particular, the medium expands more\nalong one direction than others, leading to unequal pressures (and particle yields) in different\nazimuthal directions, and this anisotropy may persist through much of the QGP’s evolution\n[7]. This anisotropy is reflected in the momentum distribution of produced particles and\nquantified using F ourier coeﬀicients vn of the azimuthal distribution of emitted particles.\nThe second harmonic (elliptic flow v2) and third harmonic (triangular flow v3) have been\nmeasured extensively at RHIC and LHC, providing direct evidence of anisotropic collective\nexpansion [8]. This indicates that the QGP , behaving nearly as an ideal fluid, retains memory\nof the initial geometry through much of its evolution.\nMomentum anisotropy is expected to influence the thermodynamic and transport prop-\nerties of QCD matter, especially at finite temperature and non-zero chemical potentials.\nWhile lattice QCD (LQCD) calculations indicate that the transition from QGP to hadrons\nis a smooth crossover at low baryon density [9–15], the notorious sign problem limits LQCD\nat high density [ 16], so one must rely on QCD low-energy effective models to explore this\nregime. In the literature, these models are widely used to explore the phase structure of\ndense matter, and they generally predict the existence of a first-order chiral phase tran-\nsition terminating in a critical end point (CEP) [ 17–22]. Experimental facilities such as\nNICA at JINR (Russia) [ 23], F AIR at GSI (Germany), including its CBM [24] and P ANDA\n[25] experiments, as well as J-P ARC (Japan) [ 26], aim to provide critical insights into the\nproperties of QCD matter at high baryon densities. Effective models provide a controlled\nframework to include essential QCD features such as spontaneous chiral symmetry break-\ning and confinement. These include the quark-meson coupling (QMC) model [ 27, 28], the\nPolyakov-loop extended QMC (PQMC) model [ 29], the Nambu-Jona-Lasinio (NJL) model\n[30, 31], the Polyakov NJL (PNJL) model [ 32, 33], the linear sigma model (LSM) [ 34], its\n2Polyakov extended version PLSM [ 35], the chiral SU(3) quark mean field model (CQMF)\n[36], and Polyakov CQMF (PCQMF) model [ 37]. In addition, other approaches such as the\nfunctional renormalization group approach [38, 39] and Dyson-Schwinger equation approach\n[40] have also been proposed to probe the behaviour of QCD at finite chemical potentials.\nThese models have been widely applied to investigate the thermodynamic [41] and transport\nproperties [ 42, 43] of strongly interacting matter.\nRecent model developments account for effects such as strong magnetic and electric fields\n[44–51], finite volume [52–58], non-extensivity [59, 60], and vorticity [61, 62] to faithfully cap-\nture the complexity of the QCD matter produced in uRHIC. Conventionally , these models\nhave relied on the assumption that quark matter remains perfectly isotropic in momentum\nspace in the absence of magnetic fields. However, realistic QGP is inherently anisotropic\ndue to initial geometric asymmetry and unequal expansion dynamics along the longitudinal\n(beam) and transverse directions of the medium. Initial spatial anisotropy causes signif-\nicantly lower pressure along the longitudinal direction, resulting in faster expansion and\ncooling along the beam direction [ 7]. As a result, the transverse momenta of particles dom-\ninate significantly over longitudinal momenta, making the parton momentum distributions\nanisotropic [ 63]. Hydrodynamic and AdS/CFT analyses, as well as classical Y ang–Mills\nsimulations within the color-glass-condensate framework [5, 64–66], all indicate that the mo-\nmentum anisotropy persists for at least τ ≲ 2 fm/c, with pressure ratios PL/PT well below\nunity . These results show that a realistic phenomenological analysis of strongly interacting\nmatter must incorporate momentum anisotropy .\nThe anisotropic momentum distributions not only modifies the local properties of the\nQGP but also induces chromo-W eibel instabilities associated with color collective modes,\ndriving rapid redistribution of energy and momentum, thereby shaping the QGP’s early-\ntime evolution and subsequent hydrodynamic behavior [ 67–70]. In practice, momentum\nanisotropy is typically modelled by a parameter ξ, which encodes the degree of deformation\nalong a specified direction, effectively quantifying the extent to which the distribution is\nstretched or compressed relative to isotropy . This approach, first developed by Romatschke\nand Strickland [7], has since become a central tool in kinetic and hydrodynamic treatments\nof anisotropic QGP . Numerous studies have explored how momentum anisotropy alters key\nobservables, from photon and dilepton yields [ 71–73] to parton self-energies [ 74, 75], heavy-\n3quark potentials [76–78], quarkonium states [79–81], jet-quenching coeﬀicients [82], and fun-\ndamental transport coeﬀicients [ 83, 84], as well as non-equilibrium hydrodynamic behavior\n[85].\nMomentum anisotropy can significantly modify the equation of state and the transport\nproperties of the QGP . T ransport coeﬀicients, such as shear viscosityη, bulk viscosity ζb, and\nelectrical conductivity σel, which govern the QGP’s response to gradients and external fields,\nare known to be particularly sensitive to anisotropic effects. Recent studies have explored\nthese effects on QCD matter using various effective models. F or instance, a 2+1 flavor quark-\nmeson (QM) model showed that increasing the anisotropy parameter, ξ, suppresses ηand σel\nand leads to a nontrivial behavior inζb [86]. A similar reduction in viscosity and conductivity\nwas confirmed using a quasiparticle relaxation time approximation (R T A) to the Boltzmann\nequation [ 87]. Within the PNJL model, Ref. [ 84] found that anisotropy amplified baryon-\nnumber fluctuations, enhancing kurtosis, skewness, and deforming isentropic trajectories.\nRef. [ 83] showed that σel increases with temperature but is suppressed by anisotropy in a\nquasiparticle R T A setup. In a three-flavor PQM analysis impact of finite anisotropy on nature\nof phase transition has been explored in Ref. [ 88]. The above various studies underscore\nthe importance of incorporating momentum-space anisotropy for accurately describing the\nthermodynamic properties and transport coeﬀicients of QCD matter.\nMotivated by this, we aim to examine the influence of momentum anisotropy on the ther-\nmodynamic observables and transport coeﬀicients of strongly interacting matter within the\nPolyakov chiral SU(3) quark mean field (PCQMF) model, across a wide range of temper-\natures and chemical potentials relevant to heavy-ion collisions. The PCQMF model is an\neffective framework that incorporates both chiral and deconfinement dynamics by including\nPolyakov loop variables in a three-flavor chiral mean field model. It contains quark inter-\nactions with scalar and vector meson fields, which drive chiral symmetry breaking and its\nrestoration, along with a Polyakov loop potential that effectively captures gluon dynamics\nfor confinement. This approach effectively reproduces QCD thermodynamics across a range\nof temperatures and chemical potentials [ 89]. It has been used to study the fluctuations of\nconserved charges [90], nonextensive [91], finite-volume effects [92], and properties of nuclear\nas well as quark stars [93, 94]. The momentum-space anisotropy is incorporated via a dimen-\nsionless parameter ξ, which quantifies the extent of deformation along a specific direction,\n4thereby capturing deviations from local isotropy in the medium. Employing the anisotropic\nPCQMF framework, we compute key thermodynamic quantities, including pressure, energy\ndensity , entropy density , speed of sound, and specific heat. W e then calculate transport co-\neﬀicients, such as shear viscosity , bulk viscosity , and electrical conductivity , by solving the\nrelativistic Boltzmann equation (RBE) within the R T A under anisotropic conditions. W e as-\nsume an isotropic relaxation time τ, following standard practice, and discuss the implications\nand limitations of this assumption in the section II C. It should be noted that implementing\nanisotropy affects only the momentum dependence within distribution functions and does\nnot introduce new fundamental interactions. Additionally , we restrict ourselves to a weakly\nanisotropic medium, i.e., |ξ| <1, allowing us to expand the anisotropic distribution function\nlinearly around its isotropic equilibrium form. This enables us to decompose the transport\ncoeﬀicients explicitly into isotropic contributions and anisotropic corrections [ 83].\nThe remainder of this paper is structured as follows. In Sec. II A, we outline the theo-\nretical framework of the PCQMF model. The incorporation of momentum-space anisotropy\ninto the PCQMF model is presented in Sec. II B. Anisotropic expressions of the transport\ncoeﬀicients are derived in Sec. II C. In Sec. III, we examine the influence of momentum\nanisotropy on the thermodynamic and transport properties of the medium, with compar-\nisons to available lattice QCD results. Finally , Sec. IV summarizes our findings and offers\nphysical interpretations of the observed effects.\nII. METHODOLOGY\nIn this section, we detail the theoretical framework employed to investigate the impact\nof momentum anisotropy on the thermodynamic and transport properties of quark matter\nand its implications on the QCD phase diagram. W e begin with an overview of the PCQMF\nmodel. Then, we outline the procedure for incorporating momentum anisotropy into the\nmodel and derive the anisotropic expressions for shear viscosity , bulk viscosity , and electrical\nconductivity by employing the RBE within R T A.\n5A. The PCQMF Model\nThe PCQMF model is an effective QCD-based framework that incorporates key non-\nperturbative aspects of QCD, specifically , spontaneous breaking of chiral symmetry and\nquark confinement, within a thermodynamically consistent mean-field approximation [ 37].\nThe Lagrangian density is expressed as\nLPCQMF = Lchiral − U(Φ,¯Φ,T). (1)\nHere, the term Lchiral contains the interactions between quarks and mesonic fields, along with\nself-interaction terms that govern spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking and its subsequent\nrestoration at finite temperature and density . The quantity U(Φ,¯Φ,T) denotes the effective\nPolyakov loop potential, which encodes the deconfinement transition dynamics via the traced\nPolyakov loop variable Φ and its conjugate ¯Φ. The chiral Lagrangian is decomposed as [ 95]\nLchiral = Lq0 + Lqm + LM + L∆m, (2)\nwhere Lq0 = ¯ψ(iγµ∂µ)ψ describes the kinetic part of the free quark fields ψ = ( u,d,s ). The\nquark-meson interactions are incorporated by the term Lqm which is given by\nLqm = gs\n(¯ψLMψR + ¯ψRM+ψL\n)\n− gv\n(¯ψLγµlµψL + ¯ψRγµrµψR\n)\n, (3)\nwhere gs and gv denote the scalar and vector coupling constants, respectively , determin-\ning the strength of the quark interactions with the corresponding mesonic fields. The\nscalar(pseudoscalar) and vector(axial-vector) meson nonets are defined as M(M+) =\n1√\n2\n∑8\na=0(σa ± iπa)λa and lµ(rµ) = 1\n2\n√\n2\n∑8\na=0(va\nµ ± ra\nµ)λa, respectively , with λa being\nthe Gell-Mann matrices. The dynamics of the meson sector are described by the term\nLM = LΣΣ + LV V + LSB . The first term LΣΣ, details the self-interactions of the scalar\nmesons and is written as\nLΣΣ = −1\n2 k0χ2 (σ2 + ζ2 + δ2) + k1 (σ2 + ζ2 + δ2)2\n+k2\n(\nσ4\n2 + δ4\n2 + 3σ2δ2 + ζ4\n)\n+ k3χ(σ2 − δ2) ζ− k4χ4\n−1\n4 χ4lnχ4\nχ4\n0\n+ d\n3 χ4ln\n((\n(σ2−δ2)ζ\nσ2\n0ζ0\n)(\nχ3\nχ3\n0\n))\n, (4)\n6which includes the scalar dilaton (glueball) field χto incorporate the broken scale invariance\n[96, 97]. The second term, LV V , accounts for the self-interactions among vector mesons\nLV V = 1\n2\nχ2\nχ2\n0\n(m2\nωω2 + m2\nρρ2 + m2\nϕϕ2) + g4(ω4 + 6ω2ρ2 + ρ4 + 2ϕ4). (5)\nLastly , the termLSB is included to explicitly break the chiral symmetry in the model, thereby\nproviding mass to the pseudoscalar mesons. This term is defined as\nLSB = −χ2\nχ2\n0\n(hxσ+ hyζ) , (6)\nwith hx = m2\nπfπ and hy = (\n√\n2m2\nKfK − 1√\n2 m2\nπfπ). An additional term, L∆m = −∆ms ¯ψSψ,\nis introduced in Eq. ( 2) to fine tune the strange quark mass, with ∆ms = 29 Me V and\nS = 1\n3\n(\nI− λ8\n√\n3\n)\n= diag(0 ,0,1). Within the mean-field approximation, the meson fields\nare replaced by their expectation values. The scalar fields: non-strange σ, strange ζ, and\nthe isovector scalar δ fields (for isospin asymmetric matter) and the vector fields: ωµ →\nωδµ0, ρµa → ρδµ0δa3, and, ϕµ → ϕδµ0 have nonzero expectation values. The parameters\nof Lagrangian ( k0,k1,...) and the quark-meson couplings ( gs,gv), are fixed by requiring the\nmodel to reproduce key properties of QCD in the vacuum. These constraints include the\nmasses of low-lying scalar and pseudoscalar mesons ( π,K,σ,η,η\n′\n) in vacuum.

( 1) takes the standard logarithmic\nform [98]\nU(Φ,¯Φ,T)\nT4 = −a(T)\n2\n¯ΦΦ + b(T)ln\n[\n1 − 6¯ΦΦ + 4( ¯Φ3 + Φ3) − 3(¯ΦΦ)2]\n, (7)\nwhere the temperature dependent parameters a(T) and b(T) are given by\na(T) = a0 + a1\n(T0\nT\n)\n+ a2\n(T0\nT\n)2\n, b(T) = b3\n(T0\nT\n)3\n. (8)\n7The parameters a0 = 1 .81, a1 = −2.47, a2 = 15 .2, and b3 = −1.75 are determined to repro-\nduce thermodynamic results from pure gauge lattice QCD simulations [ 99]. The parameter\nT0 represents the critical temperature and in the pure gauge sector is typically ∼ 270 Me V\n[100]. However, when fermions are included, its value depends on the number of quark flavors\nNf [101]. Additionally , the presence of these dynamical quarks influences the gluons that\nshape the effective Polyakov loop potential (quark backreaction). T o account for dynamical\nquark effects on the Polyakov loop, an effective glue potential is introduced [ 102], with the\nmapping between glue and pure gauge temperatures defined as\nTY M − TY M\n0\nTY M\n0\n= 0 .57Tglue − Tglue\n0\nTglue\n0\n, Uglue(Φ,¯Φ,Tglue)\nT4\nglue\n= UY M (Φ,¯Φ,TY M )\nT4\nY M\n, (9)\nwhere Tglue is identified with the system temperature T, and TY M\n0 = Tglue\n0 = 200 Me V, in\nthis work.\nIn the mean field approximation, the thermodynamic potential per unit volume in a grand\ncanonical ensemble at a given temperature T and chemical potential µ takes the form [ 92]\nΩPCQMF = Ω q¯q + Ωvac + U(Φ,¯Φ,T) − LM − Vvac, (10)\nwhere Ωq¯q comprises of quark and antiquark thermal contribution and is written as\nΩq¯q =\n∑\ni=u,d,s\n−γiT\n(2π)3\n∫\nd3k\n{\nlnF−\ni (k) + ln F+\ni (k)\n}\n, (11)\nwith\nF−\ni (k) = 1 + e−3E−\ni (k) + 3Φe−E−\ni (k) + 3 ¯Φe−2E−\ni (k), (12)\nF+\ni (k) = 1 + e−3E+\ni (k) + 3 ¯Φe−E+\ni (k) + 3Φe−2E+\ni (k), (13)\nand γi = 2 is the spin degeneracy . The dimensionless energies are defined as E±\ni (k) =\n(E∗\ni (k) ± µi∗)/T with E∗\ni (k) =\n√\nk2 + m∗2\ni being the effective energy of a quark of flavor i\nand m∗\ni being the effective quark mass generated dynamically through its coupling to the\nscalar fields and is given as\nmi\n∗ = −gi\nσσ− gi\nζζ− gi\nδδ+ ∆mi, (14)\nwhere gi\nσ,ζ,δ are the respective scalar coupling constants and ∆mu,d = 0 . Similarly , the\neffective chemical potential µ∗\ni is shifted from its vacuum value µi and is defined in terms of\n8vector fields through relation\nµi\n∗ = µi − gi\nωω− gi\nϕϕ− gi\nρρ. (15)\nThe vector coupling constants gi\nω,ϕ,ρ determine the strength of the repulsive vector in-\nteractions. F or asymmetric quark matter, the quark chemical potentials are related to\nthe baryon µB, isospin µI, and strangeness µS chemical potentials through the relations\nµB = 3\n2 (µu + µd),µI = 1\n2 (µu − µd), and µS = 1\n2 (µu + µd − 2µs). The fermionic vacuum term,\nΩvac, in Eq. ( 10) is given by\nΩvac = −2Nc\n∑\ni=u,d,s\n∫ d3k\n(2π)3 E∗\ni (k). (16)\nThis integral is divergent and regularized using dimensional regularization as [ 103]\nΩvac = − Nc\n(8π2)\n∑\ni=u,d,s\nm∗2\ni ln\n(m∗\ni\nΛ0\n)\n, (17)\nwhere Λ0 = 600 Me V is the regularization scale parameter. A constant, Vvac in Eq. ( 10) is\nsubtracted to ensure zero vacuum energy . The temperature dependence of the scalar, vector,\nand Polyakov fields is determined by solving the coupled equations of motion obtained by\nminimizing ΩPCQMF with respect to each field. The scalar density ρs\ni and the vector density\nρi for each quark flavor are then calculated as\nρs\ni = γiNc\n∫ d3k\n(2π)3\nm∗\ni\nE∗\ni (k)\n(\nfi(k) + ¯fi(k)\n)\n, (18)\nρi = γiNc\n∫ d3k\n(2π)3\n(\nfi(k) − ¯fi(k)\n)\n, (19)\nrespectively . The equilibrium distribution functions for quarks fi(k) and antiquarks ¯fi(k),\nwhich include the effects of the Polyakov loop, are given by [ 89]\nfi(k) = Φe−E−\ni (k) + 2 ¯Φe−2E−\ni (k) + e−3E−\ni (k)\n[1 + 3Φ e−E−\ni (k) + 3 ¯Φe−2E−\ni (k) + e−3E−\ni (k)]\n, (20)\n¯fi(k) =\n¯Φe−E+\ni (k) + 2Φe−2E+\ni (k) + e−3E+\ni (k)\n[1 + 3 ¯Φe−E+(k)\ni + 3Φe−2E+\ni (k) + e−3E+\ni (k)]\n. (21)\n9B. Incorporation of Momentum-Space Anisotropy\nT o phenomenologically account for the effects of local momentum-space anisotropy , we\nfollow the spheroidal momentum deformation proposed by Romatschke and Strickland [ 7].\nThis approach is characterized by rescaling momentum in a preferred direction and intro-\nducing a dimensionless anisotropy parameter, ξ, which is defined based on the components\nof momentum parallel ( p∥) and perpendicular ( p⊥) to the direction of anisotropy ( ˆn) as\nξ = ⟨p2\n⊥⟩\n2⟨p2\n∥⟩ − 1, (22)\nwith −1 < ξ < ∞. The parameter ξ has a value of −1 before the collision when the\nwhole of the system’s momentum is along the longitudinal direction, implying a maximally\nstretched distribution along the direction of anisotropy . F or values of −1 < ξ <0, the\nparticle distribution is stretched along the anisotropy direction, while ξ >0 indicates the\nparticle distribution is squeezed (contracted) along that direction. ξ = 0 corresponds to an\nisotropic momentum distribution while ξ = ∞ implies that all particles are moving along\nthe transverse direction or maximally squeezed along the anisotropy direction.\nF or a given anisotropy direction ˆn, the quark momentum, k, is modified to ˜k\n˜k2 = k2 + ξ(k · ˆn)2, (23)\nwhich in turn modifies the effective single-particle energy of a quark of flavor i to\nE∗\ni,aniso(k) =\n√\n˜k2 + m2\ni =\n√\nE∗2\ni (k) + ξk2 cos2 θ, (24)\nwhere θ is the angle between k and the anisotropy axis. F or a weakly anisotropic medium\nwhere |ξ| <1, we expand this energy to linear order in ξ as\nE∗\ni,aniso(k) ≈ E∗\ni (k) + ξ\n(k2cos2θ\n2E∗\ni (k)\n)\n. (25)\nThis change to the effective energy propagates to the dimensionless energies E±(k) =\n(E∗\ni (k) ±µ∗\ni )/T that appear in the thermodynamic potential. The anisotropic dimensionless\nenergy can thus be written as\nE±\ni,aniso(k) = E±\ni (k) + δE, (26)\n10where the dimensionless correction, δE, is given by\nδE = ξ\n(k2cos2θ\n2E∗\ni (k)T\n)\n. (27)\nThus, introducing momentum anisotropy into the system leads to the single particle ef-\nfective energy to become direction dependent. In particular, particles moving closer to the\nanisotropic direction (typically the beam axis in uRHIC) acquire an additional contribution\nto their energy proportional to cos2θ. This directional deformation of the effective energy\ninduces anisotropic modification in the thermodynamic potential density of the PCQMF\nmodel. This results in anisotropic corrections to the thermodynamic and transport prop-\nerties. The anisotropic functions are obtained by substituting E±\ni,aniso(k) for E±\ni (k) in their\nexpressions. F or any function g(E±\ni (k)) that depends on the dimensionless quark energy , its\nanisotropic counterpart g(E±\ni,aniso(k)), can be approximated to linear order in ξ as\ng(E±\ni,aniso(k)) ≈ g(E±\ni (k)) + ∂g(E±\ni (k))\n∂E±\ni (k) δE. (28)\nW e apply this linear expansion to the quark-antiquark contribution in the thermodynamic\npotential, Ωq¯q, gets modified as\nΩq¯q,aniso =\n∑\ni=u,d,s\n−γiT\n(2π)3\n∫\nd3k\n{\nlnF−\ni,aniso(k) + ln F+\ni,aniso(k)\n}\n. (29)\nUsing Eq. ( 28) for lnF±\ni,aniso(k), the Eq. ( 29) can be written as\nΩq¯q,aniso = Ω q¯q + ξ\n( ∑\ni=u,d,s\nγiNc\n12π2E∗\ni (k)\n∫\nk4dk[fi(k) + ¯fi(k)]\n)\n. (30)\nSimilarly , the anisotropic scalar and vector densities can be identified by differentiating the\nabove equation with respect to σ and ω, respectively , as\nρs\ni,aniso = ρs\ni − ξ\n( γiNc\n12π2T\n∫\nk4dk m∗\ni\nE∗2\ni (k) [Ai(k) + Bi(k)]\n)\n, (31)\nρi,aniso = ρi + ξ\n( γiNc\n12π2T\n∫ k4dk\nE∗\ni (k) [Ai(k) − Bi(k)]\n)\n, (32)\nwhere the terms\nAi(k) =\n(\nΦe−E−\ni (k) + 4 ¯Φe−2E−\ni (k) + 3e−3E−\ni (k)\n)\n− 3fi(k)\n(\nΦe−E−\ni (k) + 2 ¯Φe−2E−\ni (k) + e−3E−\ni (k)\n)\nF−\ni (k)\n(33)\n11and\nBi(k) =\n(\n¯Φe−E+\ni (k) + 4Φe−2E+\ni (k) + 3e−3E+\ni (k)\n)\n− 3 ¯fi(k)\n(\n¯Φe−E+\ni (k) + 2Φe−2E+\ni (k) + e−3E+\ni (k)\n)\nF+\ni (k) .\n(34)\nThe anisotropic distribution functions, fi,aniso(k) and ¯fi,aniso(k) are then approximated as\nfi,aniso(k) ≈ fi(k) +\n( ∂fi(k)\n∂E−\ni (k)\n)\nδE ≡ fi(k) + δfi(k), (35)\n¯fi,aniso(k) ≈ ¯fi(k) +\n( ∂¯fi(k)\n∂E+\ni (k)\n)\nδE ≡ ¯fi(k) + δ¯fi(k), (36)\nwhich can be split into isotropic and anisotropic parts as\nfi,aniso(k) = fi(k) − ξ\n(k2cos2θ\n2E∗\ni (k)T [fi(k)(1 − 3fi(k)) + Xi(k)]\n)\n, (37)\n¯fi,aniso(k) = ¯fi(k) − ξ\n(k2cos2θ\n2E∗\ni (k)T\n[¯fi(k)(1 − 3 ¯fi(k)) + Yi(k)\n])\n, (38)\nwith\nXi(k) =\n2\n(\n¯Φe−2E−\ni (k) + e−3E−\ni (k)\n)\nF−\ni (k) , Y i(k) =\n2\n(\nΦe−2E+\ni (k) + e−3E+\ni (k)\n)\nF+\ni (k) . (39)\nC. T ransport coeﬀicients in anisotropic PCQMF model\nThe transport coeﬀicients can be derived from the RBE, which describes the evolution of\nthe single particle distribution function in phase space. F or systems close to the equilibrium\nin presence of external field, one can use the R T A to simplify the complex collision term,\nand the RBE is then written as [ 104]\nkµ∂µf(x,k) + qFαβkβ\n∂\n∂kα f(x,k) = C[f(x,k)] = −kµuµ\nτ (f(x,k) − f0(x,k)) = −kµuµ\nτ δf,\n(40)\nwhere q is the charge of a quark and Fαβ represent the electromagnetic field strength tensor.\nThe term uµ is the fluid four-velocity , τ is the relaxation time for the particle species, and\nδf = f(x,k) − f0(x,k) is the deviation from the local equilibrium distribution f0(x,k) given\nin Eq. ( 20). The relaxation time τ is given by [ 105]\nτ = 1\n5.1Tα2\nSln(1/αS)(1 + 0 .12(2Nf + 1)) , (41)\n12where αs(T,µ) is the standard two-loop running coupling written as [ 106, 107]\nαS(T,µ) = 6π\n(33 − 2Nf )ln\n(\nT\nΛT\n√\n1 + ( µ\nπT )2\n)\n\n1 − 3(153 − 19Nf )\n(33 − 2Nf )2\nln\n(\n2ln T\nΛT\n√\n1 + ( µ\nπT )2\n)\nln\n(\nT\nΛT\n√\n1 + ( µ\nπT )2\n)\n\n,\n(42)\nwith ΛT being the QCD scale-fixing parameter originating from the lowest nonzero Matsub-\nara modes [ 108] and is fixed at ΛT = 70 Me V [107]. W e assume τ to remain isotropic even\nin the presence of momentum anisotropy in the distribution functions. This is a simplifying\napproximation that allows us to isolate the direct effect of the anisotropic particle distri-\nbution on the transport coeﬀicients. While a fully self-consistent treatment would involve\nan anisotropic relaxation time, this approach is standard in many initial phenomenological\nstudies [83, 86, 87].\nThe transport coeﬀicients quantify the linear response of a system to small gradients\nor external fields. They are extracted from the dissipative parts of the energy-momentum\ntensor Tµν and conserved current densities such as electric currentJµ. The general procedure\ninvolves measuring small perturbations in the local equilibrium distribution function f0 as\nδf = f − f0 using the RBE within R T A, in the presence of appropriate gradients, e.g.,\nvelocity gradient for shear and bulk viscosities, or electric field for conductivity . δf is then\nsubstituted into the expressions of Tµν or Jµ, and the transport coeﬀicients quantify the\nlinear response of a system by relating dissipative fluxes to their associated thermodynamic\ngradients.

The anisotropic terms are pro-\nportional to ξ and introduce angular integrals (involving cos2θ) which result in enhancing\nor suppressing contributions from longitudinal modes, depending on the sign of ξ. Although\nthe overall form of the integrals remains similar to the isotropic case, the anisotropic compo-\nnents carry higher powers of momentum, encoding their sensitivity to directional flow and\ngradients in the medium. This decomposition of transport coeﬀicients into isotropic and\nanisotropic parts enables their systematic numerical analysis.\nIII. RESUL TS\nIn this section, we present and discuss the impact of momentum-space anisotropy , char-\nacterized by the parameter ξ, on the chiral and deconfinement order parameters, various\nthermodynamic observables, and key transport coeﬀicients of strongly interacting QCD mat-\nter within the PCQMF model. The analysis is performed for two distinct scenarios: one at\nvanishing baryon chemical potential ( µB = 0 Me V) and another at a finite baryon chemical\npotential ( µB = 400 Me V). The results are presented for different values of the anisotropy\nparameter: the isotropic case ξ = 0 .0, oblate (squeezed) distributions with ξ = 0 .2 and\nξ = 0 .4, and a prolate (stretched) case with ξ = −0.2.\nW e begin by examining the effect of momentum anisotropy on the effective quark masses,\nwhich are directly linked to the chiral dynamics of the system. Fig. 1 shows the effective\nquark masses m∗\nu, m∗\nd, and m∗\ns as a function of temperature T. The left panels [(a), (c),\n(e)] correspond to µB = 0 Me V, while the right panels [(b), (d), (f)] are for a system at\nµB = 400 Me V,µI = −30 Me V, andµS = 125 Me V. F or the isotropic case (ξ = 0 ), all quark\nmasses exhibit a significant reduction with increasing temperature, reflecting the gradual\nrestoration of chiral symmetry . When anisotropy is introduced, this behavior is modified.\nF or positive values ofξ(oblate), the quark masses decrease slowly , suggesting that a squeezed\nmomentum distribution delays chiral symmetry restoration. Conversely , a negative value ofξ\n(prolate) results in a faster decrease of the quark masses, indicating that the chiral transition\nis triggered earlier. This behavior can be understood from the modification of single-particle\nenergy due to anisotropy . An oblate distribution enhances the effective thermal energy of\n15(a)\n100 150 200 250 300\nT (MeV)\n0\n50\n100\n150\n200\n250\n300\n350\nmu\n*  (MeV)\nB = 0 MeV\n = 0.0\n = 0.2\n = 0.4\n= -0.2 (b)\n100 150 200 250 300\nT (MeV)\n0\n50\n100\n150\n200\n250\n300\n350\nmu\n*  (MeV)\nB = 400 MeV\n = 0.0\n = 0.2\n = 0.4\n= -0.2\n(c)\n100 150 200 250 300\nT (MeV)\n0\n50\n100\n150\n200\n250\n300\n350\nmd\n*  (MeV)\nB = 0 MeV\n = 0.0\n = 0.2\n = 0.4\n= -0.2 (d)\n100 150 200 250 300\nT (MeV)\n0\n50\n100\n150\n200\n250\n300\n350\nmd\n*  (MeV)\nB = 400 MeV\n = 0.0\n = 0.2\n = 0.4\n= -0.2\n(e)\n100 150 200 250 300\nT (MeV)\n150\n200\n250\n300\n350\n400\n450\n500\nms\n*  (MeV)\nB = 0 MeV\n = 0.0\n = 0.2\n = 0.4\n= -0.2 (f)\n100 150 200 250 300\nT (MeV)\n150\n200\n250\n300\n350\n400\n450\n500\nms\n*  (MeV)\nB = 400 MeV\n = 0.0\n = 0.2\n = 0.4\n= -0.2\nFIG. 1.

The Polyakov fields Φ and ¯Φ are plotted as a function of temperature T for anisotropy\nparameter ξ = 0, 0.2, 0.4, and −0.2, at baryon chemical potential µB = 0 Me V [in subplots (a) and\n(c)], and baryon chemical potential µB = 400 Me V, isospin chemical potentialµI = −30 Me V, and\nstrangeness chemical potential µS = 125 Me V [in subplots (b) and (d)].\nNext, we investigate the temperature dependence of Polyakov loop fields, Φ and ¯Φ for\nvarious values of ξ at µB = 0 Me V [(a), (c)] and µB = 400 Me V [(b), (d)] in Fig. 2. In\nthe isotropic case, both Φ and ¯Φ transition from values close to zero in the low-temperature\n(confined) phase to values approaching unity in the high-temperature (deconfined) phase.\nA positive ξ leads to a slight suppression of Φ and ¯Φ at intermediate temperatures, while\na negative ξ causes a minor enhancement. This may indicate that the deconfinement of\nquarks gets delayed for a system with a squeezed momentum distribution compared to the\nisotropic case. Increasing the baryon chemical potential to µB = 400 Me V leads to unequal\nenhancement in Φ and ¯Φ at lower temperatures. The effect of ξ is similar to the case of zero\nchemical potential.\n17T o more precisely quantify the chiral phase transition, we compute the subtracted chiral\ncondensate, ∆l,s, defined as [ 114]\n∆l,s(T) =\n⟨ ¯ψψ⟩l,T − ˆml\nˆms\n⟨ ¯ψψ⟩s,T\n⟨ ¯ψψ⟩l,0 − ˆml\nˆms\n⟨ ¯ψψ⟩s,0\n, (55)\nwhere ˆml and ˆms denote the bare masses of light and strange quarks, respectively , and are\ndirectly related to the symmetry breaking parameters hx and hy appearing in Eq. ( 6) [21].\nAdditionally , in the context of the PCQMF model, the light quark condensate ⟨ ¯ψψ⟩l,T and\nstrange quark condensate ⟨ ¯ψψ⟩s,T can be replaced with the non-strange σand strange ζ field,\nrespectively . As a result, we can write the subtracted chiral condensate as\n∆l,s(T) =\nσ− hx\nhy\nζ\nσ0 − hx\nhy\nζ0\n, (56)\nwhere σ0 and ζ0 denote the vacuum values of the scalar fields. This observable provides a\nclear signal for the chiral crossover. In Fig. 3, we plot ∆l,s as a function of temperature\nat various values of ξ. The left panel shows the results at µB = 0 Me V, which are in good\nqualitative agreement with lattice QCD data from Ref. [ 115]. Positive values of ξ shift the\ntransition curve to higher temperatures, while a negative ξ shifts it to lower temperatures.\nThis confirms that a prolate momentum distribution promotes an earlier chiral transition,\nwhereas an oblate distribution delays it. At µB = 400 Me V (right panel), the transition\ntemperature is lowered, as expected, and the separation between the curves for different ξ\nvalues remains significant, highlighting the persistent role of anisotropy at finite density .\nThe impact of momentum anisotropy on the bulk thermodynamic properties of the quark\nmatter is presented in Fig. 4. Here, we plot the scaled pressure p/T4, scaled energy density\nϵ/T4, and scaled entropy density s/T3 as functions of temperature. The left panels [(a), (c),\n(e)] at µB = 0 are compared with lattice data. F or all cases, these quantities remain small\nin the confined phase and rise with temperature, finally approaching the Stefan-Boltzmann\n(SB) limit at very highT. Our results are in good qualitative agreement with the lattice data.\nA key finding is that the equation of state is directly modified by momentum anisotropy .\nPositive ξ values lead to a suppression in pressure, energy density , and entropy density at\na given temperature, while negative ξ values lead to their enhancement. This implies that\na system with a stretched momentum distribution is thermodynamically more active than\nan isotropic one.

At µB = 0 (top row), the speed of sound exhibits a characteristic\ndip near the transition temperature. The location and depth of this minimum are sensitive\nto anisotropy . A positive ξ makes the dip deeper and shifts it towards higher temperatures.\nIn contrast, a negative ξ shifts the dip to lower temperatures, consistent with the observed\nchange in the chiral transition. The specific heat displays a corresponding peak in the\ntransition region, which shifts to lower magnitude for positive ξ and grows for negative ξ.\nOur results for both quantities at zero chemical potential are in qualitative agreement with\navailable lattice data [12, 14]. At µB = 400 Me V (bottom row), these features are shifted to\nlower temperatures, with the softening of the equation of state being particularly evident.\nW e now turn to the transport properties of the anisotropic quark matter. Fig. 6 presents\nthe specific shear viscosity ,ηaniso/s, and the normalized bulk viscosity , ζb,aniso/sas functions\nof temperature, for various ξ. Shear viscosity characterizes a fluid’s resistance to shear stress,\nessentially its internal friction.

Momentum anisotropy has a significant impact; a positive ξ (squeezed)\ndecreases ηaniso/s, making the fluid less viscous and pushing the system even closer to the\nperfect fluid. This behavior is attributed to the growth of chromo-W eibel instabilities in\nthe anisotropically expanding plasma. These instabilities generate turbulent color fields\nthat provide a highly eﬀicient, non-collisional mechanism for momentum transport, thereby\nreducing the effective shear viscosity [87, 124]. In contrast, a negative ξ (stretched) increases\nηaniso/s, resulting in a more viscous fluid. Such a prolate momentum configuration is expected\nto arise in the presence of a strong magnetic field, which constrains the motion of charged\nquarks to the lowest Landau level along the field direction [125]. This is similar to the results\nobtained in the quasiparticle model approaches [ 83, 87], 2+1 flavor QM model [ 86], and two\n22(a)\n150 200 250 300\nT (MeV)\n0\n0.05\n0.1\n0.15\n0.2\n0.25\n0.3\n0.35el,aniso/T\nB = 0 MeV\n=0\n=0.2\n=0.4\n=-0.2\nlattice (b)\n150 200 250 300\nT (MeV)\n0\n0.05\n0.1\n0.15\n0.2\nel,aniso/T\nB = 400 MeV\n=0\n=0.2\n=0.4\n=-0.2\nFIG. 7.

At a finite baryon chemical potential of µB = 400 Me V (Fig. 6 (c)),\nthe overall magnitude of ηaniso/sincreases across the temperature range, indicating that the\nsystem becomes more viscous at higher densities. Similar observations were reported in Ref.\n[87]. The normalized bulk viscosity at µB = 0 Me V is plotted in Fig. 6 (b). This transport\ncoeﬀicient, which is a measure of the system’s deviation from conformal invariance [126, 127],\nis significant near the transition and diminishes at high temperatures, signaling the system’s\napproach to the conformal limit where bulk viscosity is expected to vanish [128]. Our results\nfor µB = 0 Me V (top row), which show a distinct peak in ζb,aniso/s in the transition region,\nare in good agreement with lattice calculations [ 129, 130]. The introduction of anisotropy\nhas a minimal effect on ζb,aniso/sbeyond the transition temperature. A squeezed momentum\ndistribution ξ >0 slightly suppresses it, while a stretched distribution ξ <0 enhances it\nnear the transition temperature. At higher temperatures, the effect of ξon ζb,aniso/sbecomes\nnegligible. As for the case of finite baryon chemical potential of µB = 400 Me V in Fig. 6\n(d), we find that the magnitude of ζb,aniso/s is substantially suppressed compared to the\nµB = 0 case, and the effects of anisotropy become even less significant. This reduction\nat finite density is consistent with the general expectation that the system moves closer to\nconformality at higher densities for a given temperature.\nThe effect of anisotropy on charge transport is examined via the normalized electrical\n23conductivity ,σel,aniso/T, which is shown as a function of temperature in Fig. 7. The electrical\nconductivity increases with temperature as charge-carrying quarks become deconfined and\nmore mobile. Our results for µB = 0 Me V (left panel) are in reasonable agreement with\nlattice data [ 131]. The effect of anisotropy on conductivity is similar to its impact on shear\nand bulk viscosity . A positive ξ (squeezed distribution), is found to suppress the electrical\nconductivity . This suppression becomes more significant as the anisotropy increases. This is\nconsistent with the findings of Ref. [125], where the authors argue that an oblate momentum\ndistribution hinders the transport of charge along the direction of the applied electric field.\nIn contrast, a negative ξ(stretched distribution) enhances the conductivity . This is similar to\nthe findings in the 2+1 flavor QM model [86], however contrasts the results in two flavor NJL\nmodel, where σel/T first increases as ξ increases at low temperatures, but as temperature\nrises further, the values of σel/T for different ξ eventually overlap [ 112]. At finite baryon\nchemical potential (right panel), the overall magnitude of the electrical conductivity is higher\nthan at µB = 0 . This is a direct consequence of the increased net charge carrier density (an\nexcess of quarks over antiquarks) at finite µB. Importantly , the relative effect of ξ remains\nthe same as in the vanishing chemical potential case. Similar findings were reported in\nquasiparticle model approaches in Refs. [ 83] and [ 87].\nFinally , in Fig. 8, we display the thermal dependence of two important quantities that\ncharacterize the dissipative nature of the medium: the specific sound channel, (ηaniso +\n3ζb,aniso/4)/s, and the ratio of bulk to shear viscosity , ζb,aniso/ηaniso, for various ξ values.\nThe behavior of the specific sound channel (left panel) is largely governed by the specific\nshear viscosity , as the bulk viscosity contribution is negligible in comparison across most\nof the temperature range, except in the vicinity of the transition region, as shown in Fig.\n6 (b) and (d). Consequently , the specific sound channel exhibits a minimum near Tc, and\nits dependence on ξ directly mirrors that of ηaniso/s. The bulk-to-shear ratio, ζb,aniso/ηaniso,\nprovides a measure of the interplay between bulk and shear viscous effects. This ratio\nexhibits a prominent peak in the transition region at µB = 0 Me V (Fig. 8(b)), indicating\nthat bulk viscosity is most significant during the phase transition. Momentum anisotropy\ninfluences the location of this peak: positive anisotropy ( ξ >0) shifts this peak to higher\ntemperatures, while negative anisotropy (ξ <0) shifts it to lower T. At µB = 400 Me V (Fig.\n8(d)), the peak becomes less pronounced and shifts to lower temperatures.

This finding\nis consistent with the general expectation that the relative importance of bulk viscosity\ndiminishes as the system moves away from the crossover region into the denser, more weakly\ninteracting regime.\nIV. SUMMAR Y\nIn this work, we have presented a comprehensive analysis of the impact of momentum-\nspace anisotropy on the thermodynamic equation of state, and transport properties of\nstrongly interacting quark matter. Employing the Polyakov chiral SU(3) quark mean field\n25(PCQMF) model, which captures both chiral symmetry dynamics and quark confinement\nthrough a Polyakov loop potential, we introduce anisotropy via a spheroidal deformation in\nthe momentum distribution, quantified by the parameter ξ. A system with a “squeezed” or\noblate momentum distribution (ξ >0) preferentially populates transverse momentum states,\ncharacteristic of the rapid longitudinal expansion in the early stages of heavy-ion collisions.\nWhile a “stretched” or prolate distribution (ξ <0) favors momenta along the anisotropy axis,\na scenario expected to arise in the presence of a strong magnetic field, with ξ =0 represent-\ning the isotropic case. Our investigation reveals that even weak anisotropy profoundly alters\nthe system’s characteristics. W e find that key thermodynamic observables like pressure,\nenergy density , entropy density , squared speed of sound, and specific heat are systemati-\ncally suppressed for squeezed systems ( ξ >0) and enhanced for stretched ones ( ξ <0) when\ncompared to the isotropic case at the same temperature. This demonstrates that the mo-\nmentum distribution fundamentally modifies the available phase space and thus alters the\nbulk thermodynamic properties and the equation of state of the medium.\nF urthermore, the transport coeﬀicients, calculated by solving the relativistic Boltzmann\nequation in the relaxation time approximation, exhibit a strong and systematic depen-\ndence on this anisotropy . The specific shear viscosity ( ηaniso/s) and electrical conductiv-\nity ( σel,aniso/T) are significantly suppressed for squeezed distributions ( ξ >0), pushing the\nsystem closer to the “perfect fluid” ideal and hindering charge transport, respectively . Con-\nversely , these coeﬀicients are enhanced for stretched distributions (ξ <0). The bulk viscosity\n(ζb,aniso/s) shows a similar, though less pronounced, trend, with its characteristic peak near\nthe phase transition shifting in temperature and magnitude according to the value of ξ. At\na finite baryon chemical potential of µB = 400 Me V, the absolute magnitudes ofηaniso/sand\nζb,aniso/schange, with shear viscosity increasing while bulk viscosity is suppressed. However,\nthe qualitative dependence on the sign of ξ remains the same. Collectively , these results un-\nderscore that momentum-space anisotropy is a crucial physical feature that fundamentally\nreshapes the properties of the quark-gluon plasma. Even when weak, it induces signifi-\ncant modifications in both thermodynamic and transport properties of the QCD medium.\nThe thermodynamic responses are suppressed for positive ξ. The transport coeﬀicients are\nmodified significantly with ξ, especially near the transition temperature, highlighting the\nanisotropic redistribution of microscopic transport. Its inclusion is therefore essential for\n26the realistic phenomenological modeling of the early-time, pre-equilibrium dynamics in ul-\ntrarelativistic heavy-ion collisions at facilities like RHIC, the LHC, F AIR, and NICA, and\nfor accurately bridging theoretical predictions with experimental data.\nV.
