Its ultimate goal is to provide crucial evidence that addresses the long-standing question of\nthe origin of UHE cosmic rays (UHECRs) [2–4]. GRAND plans to do so, directly, by detecting a\nvast number of UHECRs and, indirectly, by detecting the secondary gamma rays and, especially,\nthe UHE neutrinos made by the interaction of UHECRs [5]. To achieve this, GRAND plans to use\nlarge arrays of radio antennas that search for the distinctive radio signals emitted by the extensive\nair showers initiated by UHE particles interacting in the atmosphere [6, 7].\nThe radio-detection of UHECRs is a mature technique. It has been demonstrated in past\nand present detectors using overground antenna arrays [6, 7] by the Auger Engineering Radio\nArray (AERA) [8], the Low-Frequency Array (LOFAR) [9], the Taiwan Astroparticle Radiowave\nObservatory for Geo-synchrotron Emissions (TAROGE) [10], and the Tianshan Radio Experiment\nfor Neutrino Detection (TREND) [11]; using underground arrays [12] by the Askaryan Radio\nArray (ARA) [13] and the Antarctic Ross Ice Shelf Antenna Neutrino Array (ARIANNA) [14];\n– 1 –GRAND@Auger\n10 antennas\nMalargüe, Argentina\nLook for coincident\ndetection with Auger\nGRAND@Nançay\n4 antennas\nNançay, France\nFor testbenching\nGRANDProto300\n13     65 (now)      300 antennas⇢→\nDunhuang, China\nEstablish efficient autonomous\nradio-detection of air showers\nFigure 1.The GRAND prototype arrays.The three GRAND prototype arrays were deployed in 2023 and\nhave been in operation since.

Concurrent\nwith GRAND, the new Radio Detector of the AugerPrime upgrade [16], the upcoming Payload\nfor Ultrahigh Energy Observations (PUEO) [17], and the proposed next-generation Beamforming\nElevated Array for COsmic Neutrinos (BEACON) [18] and Radar Echo Telescope (RET-CR) [19]\nalso target the radio-detection of UHE particles, though adopting different, complementary [20]\ndetection strategies. References [21–23] present an overview of upcoming UHE detectors.\nBuilding on the experience gained by these experiments—most directly, by AERA and\nTREND—GRANDplanstodeployantennaarraysatalargerscale[1,24]. Thisinvolvesincreasing\nthe number of antennas deployed—to eventually tens of thousands—and deploying them in arrays\nthat are sparser than before—with km-scale antenna separations. This up-scaling is requisite for\nthe antenna arrays to monitor the large volumes of the atmosphere needed to deliver vast numbers\nofdetectedUHECRs[1]andasensitivitytoeventinyfluxesofUHEneutrinos[1,21–23,25]. The\nGRAND Collaboration plans to achieve this while keeping its carbon footprint low [26].\nSuch an enterprise involves facing technical challenges that, while significant, are surmount-\nable. To face them, GRAND is to be built with a staged construction plan [1, 27, 28] designed to\nvalidatethedesignandoperationoftheexperimentinsmallerscalesbeforedeployinglargerarrays.\nFigure 1 shows the locations of the GRAND prototypes, in operation since 2023 [28]:\nGRAND@Nançayin Nançay, France,GRANDProto300[29] in Dunhuang, China, andGRAND\n@Auger[30]inMalargüe,Argentina,atthesiteofthePierreAugerObservatory(PierreAuger)[31].\nTheir purpose is to validate two core requirements that GRAND must fulfill to achieve its goals.\nFirst, the prototypes must validate the viability of autonomous radio-detection of air showers\nin a sparse radio array [32–35], unaided by particle detectors, and despite the presence of natural\nand anthropogenic radio background that may mimic the radio signatures expected from showers.\n– 2 –Second, the prototypes must validate that the arrays are able to operate under harsh environmental\nfield conditions—high temperature, sandstorms, rainstorms—for prolonged periods of time. The\nlessons garnered from the prototypes will inform the design of the experiment in later stages.\nInthispaper,weintroducethedesignandoperationoftheGRANDprototypearrays,focusing\non the two larger ones, GRANDProto300 (GP300) and GRAND@Auger (G@A). In addition,\nwe present the first results obtained by them during their first two years of operation: the time-\ndependent and time-averaged radio spectra measured by them, including identified sources of\nradio background.The ongoing operation of the arrays—though not devoid of challenges—\ncoupled with their early-data results, validate the resilience of the GRAND design to adapt to\ndifferent environmental conditions, a requirement to pursue future, larger stages of GRAND.\nThis constitutes the basis for demonstrating the autonomous detection of cosmic rays in GRAND,\nwhich will be shown in future publications (see Ref. [35] for preliminary results).\nTheremainderofthepaperisorganizedasfollows. Section2introducestheGRANDprototype\narrays, their sites, and layouts. Section 3 describes the GRAND detection unit, its hardware,\nsoftware, and performance. Section 4 presents the self-trigger algorithm of the experiment and\nthe data acquisition software. Section 5 describes the data transfer pipeline, from local and central\nstorage on-site to permanent storage off-site. Section 6 presents the offline data-quality monitoring\ntoolsoftheexperiment. Section7showsthefirstradiospectraobservedbytheGRANDprototypes,\nincluding identified background sources. Section 8 summarizes and concludes.\n2 Overview of the GRAND prototype arrays\nThe site and array layout for each GRAND prototype were decided to fulfill their specific goals:\ntestbenching for GRAND@Nançay, demonstrating the autonomous radio-detection of air showers\nfor GP300, and observing coincident detection of air showers with the Pierre Auger detectors in\nG@A.Theradiobackgroundvariesbetweensites,withthebackgroundatGRAND@Nançaybeing\nthe loudest, and the background at GP300 being appreciably smaller than at G@A, predominantly\ndue to GP300 being farther from human activity.\nGRAND@Nançay.—GRAND@NançayisasmallarrayoffourGRANDdetectionunits(DUs,\nSection 3) located at the Nançay Radio Observatory, in France. It was conceived as a field site\naccessibletoEuropeanlaboratories,facilitatingtestbenchingofequipmentandnewideasindesign,\ntrigger, and data acquisition. The design of GRAND@Nançay resembles that of the other two\nprototype arrays, though with notable differences, such as having antennas of lower height and\ncommunications via optical fiber instead of wireless. Due to its small size, it serves primarily as a\ntestbed. In the remainder of the paper, we focus on GRANDProto300 and GRAND@Auger.\nGRANDProto300.—GP300 is the pathfinder array for GRAND in the Northern Hemisphere.\nIn its final stage, it will be a 300-antenna array; presently, it exists in partial configurations.\nThe 300-antenna stage of GP300 will span an area of about 200 km2 in the Gobi Desert near\nXiaodushan, in northern Dunhuang, China, making it the largest of the three prototypes. The site\nis a largely radio-quiet region in the 50–200 MHz radio-frequency band, which GRAND adopts as\nits working frequency band. The precise location was chosen after a survey of regions that contain\na relatively flat area capable of hosting the final 300-antenna stage of GP300, and that was located\n– 3 –□4000 □3000 □2000 □1000 0 1000 2000\nx [m]\n□2000\n□1000\n0\n1000\n2000\n3000\n4000\n5000\ny [m]\n10\n1\n8\n11\n6\n2\n9\n12\n3\n7\n4\n5\n13\n119\n116\n106\n93\n102\n91\n81\n78\n88\n47\n44\n85\n43\n37\n40\n82\n55\n31\n28\n52\n15\n20\n23\n35\n11\n8\n32\n48\n19\n51\n7\n16\n5\n27\n2\n24\n13\n39\n1\n12\n38\n4\n3\n25\n26\n50\n18\n49\n6\n17\n10\n9\n33\n34\n22\n14\n21\n54\n30\n29\n53\n42\n36\n41\n46\n45\nCS1\nCS2\nCS: Central Station\nGRANDProto300\ndetection units\nGP300 s65 (Apr 25–present)\nGP300 s13 (Jun 23–Apr 25)\n□26000 □25500 □25000 □24500\nx [m]\n14600\n14800\n15000\n15200\n15400\n15600\n15800\n16000\nCRS\n35 36\n135\n44\n5\n9\n25\n27\n82\n136 137\n146145\n152\n85 157\n58\n49\n69\n59\n83\n70\n144\n60\n84\n151\nAccess road\nCRS: Central Radio Station\nGRAND@Auger detection unit\nAERA station\nN\nFigure 2.Array layout of GRANDProto300 (left) and of GRAND@Auger (right).Each GRAND\ndetection unit (DU) has an assigned identification number.

For GRANDProto300, the DUs from the 13-antenna stage, GP300_s13, were repositioned as\npart of the 65-antenna stage, GP300_s65, in May of 2025, and the original Central Station 1 (CS1) was\nreplacedbythenewCS2.

By April of 2025, the array was extended to its current\n65-antenna stage, GP300_s65, which has been operating since and whose additional goals include\ntesting the efficiency and purity of the detection of inclined air showers from UHECRs. GP300,\neven in partial configuration, is expected to detect UHECRs with energies between 100PeV and a\nfew EeV, probing the Galactic to extragalactic transition region of cosmic ray origin.\nFigure2showsthelayoutofGP300_s13andGP300_s65.

A hexagonal array has fewer\ndirections along which the performance of shower-reconstruction methods is degraded as a result\nof the shower trajectory being aligned with the axes of symmetry of the array layout.\nGP300_s13 had a three-hexagon layout, covering an area of about 2 km2 with a DU spacing\nof about 500 m. The Central Station 1 (CS1) was built north-west of the array; it consisted of\nthree sets of container rooms that stored the central data acquisition (DAQ) computer and the\nlodgingandcookingfacilities.

The array has a dense region to the east with a DU\nspacing of 577 m and a sparse region to the west with a spacing of 1000 m. A new Central Station\n(CS2) was built for GP300_s65 and placed at its center.\nPreliminary simulations [37] estimate that the full GP300 array may detect about 130 inclined\ncosmic-rayeventsperday—foranideal100%uptimeofthedetector—intheenergyrangeof10 17–\n1020 eV, reaching a trigger efficiency of 90% already at1018.3 eV.

Although the search for these cosmic rays is\ncomplicated by firmware and DAQ changes made during prototype testing, it has already yielded\nits first likely candidates in GP300_s65 data [38–40].\nGRAND@Auger.—G@A results from an agreement between the GRAND and Pierre Auger\nCollaborations to repurpose 10 AERA radio-stations in Malargüe, Argentina, into GRAND DUs.\nThedeploymentofG@AwascompletedinAugustof2023andithasbeenoperatingsince. Because\nG@AisembeddedwithintheregionofthePierreAugerdetectorarray,itoffers,uniquelyamongthe\nthree prototypes, the opportunity to validate the radio-detection—and ensuing reconstruction—of\nairshowersthataresimultaneouslydetectedbyG@AandbythePierreAugersurfacedetector(SD)\narray of water-Cherenkov particle detectors, fluorescence telescopes, and radio antennas, the latter\nrecently deployed [16].\nFigure 2, right, shows the layout of G@A, deployed within the AERA array, itself located\nwithin the Pierre Auger 750-m SD array, and within the field of view of the Coihueco and HEAT\nfluorescence detectors [44, 45]. Ten of the AERA Phase-2 stations were modified into GRAND\nDUs. The DUs are laid on two superimposed hexagons with a predominant spacing of 250 m,\ncovering an area of 0.5 km2. The G@A central DAQ computer is located in the AERA Central\nRadio Station (CRS). Nearby roads facilitate access to the site.\nFor G@A, using a denser detector layout enhances the detection of less energetic and less\ninclined events. The estimated event rate for the Pierre Auger 750-m SD array is390±17showers\nperdayover25km 2 [46].

This leads to weaker signals in the antennas, making it generally\nmore challenging to detect showers in G@A.\n3 The GRAND detection unit\nThe GRAND detection unit (DU) consists of an antenna—theHorizonAntenna—and the elec-\ntronics to process, store, and communicate the signals detected.

During their deployment and commissioning, different configurations of the hardware and\nsoftware were installed at each array for two reasons. First, adapting the instrumentation was\nnecessary for the setups to operate under the different environmental conditions present at each\nsite.

In the following sections, we discuss the\ncharacteristics of the antenna, LNAs, the GRAND FEB, power supply, and communications setup.\n3.2 Antenna and low-noise amplifier\nAntenna.—Figure 5, left, shows that the antenna itself consists of five arms: two dipoles in the\nNorth-South and East-West directions, and a monopole in the vertical direction. The dipole size is\nroughly 1.4 m, to match the GRAND working frequency band of 50–200 MHz. Figure 5, right,\nshows the acrylic nut with an internal connector to which the antenna arms are attached. The LNA\nboard is housed in the metal base of the nut and is powered by a coaxial cable that also transports\nreceived signals to the FEB.\nFigure6showsthesimulatedresponseoftheGRANDHorizonAntennatoanincomingradio\nsignal, expressed in the form of the magnitude of the vector effective length (VEL),Leff.

[48].\nFor theHorizonAntenna, the VEL was simulated using the Ansys HFSS (high-frequency\nstructure simulator) program, with a setup that included the complete mechanical structure of the\nDU. The resulting VEL is an elaborate function of frequency, zenith, and azimuth angle that fully\ncharacterizes the response of the antenna to an arbitrary incoming plane-wave signal; see Fig. 5\nin Ref. [48]. This is an essential ingredient to produce simulated measurements and interpret real\nones.

Given the complexity of the VEL of theHorizonAntenna, its validation in\nthe field remains to be completed; a calibration campaign is planned to verify our simulations.\nFigure7showsthegroupdelayoftheHorizonAntenna,i.e.,thederivativewithrespecttothe\nfrequencyofthephaseshiftofthetransferfunctionoftheDU(Section3.4). Avaryinggroupdelay\nthroughout the working frequency range can lead to signal dispersion and loss of amplitude due to\ninterference effects. For air-shower detection and reconstruction, the shape and amplitude of the\nsignal areimportant assetsused, for example, in triggeringalgorithms. For theHorizonAntenna,\n– 9 –Figure 9.Low-noise amplifier (LNA) board deployed at GRANDProto300 (left) and GRAND@Auger\n(right).The main components of the boards are: (1) connectors to the antenna, (2) balun, (3) matching\nnetwork, (4) amplifier, and (5) power. Although the components are in similar locations, their specifications\nare not the same in both boards. See Section 3.2 for details.\nthe group delay is nearly flat in frequency for the three antenna arms, with differences well below\n20 ns that do not significantly distort the expected pulse shape. Given the frequency bandwidth of\n200 MHz, group delay variations smaller than its inverse (5 ns) are acceptable. While there are\nsharp peaksin thegroup delay, they arenarrow enough tohave onlya small effecton signalpower.\nThe antenna responseis embedded in theGRANDlibprocessing pipeline [48] (Section 3.4) andis\nused in the reconstruction of the properties of showers detected by GRAND.\nFigure8showsthegainoftheHorizonAntenna,i.e.,theratiobetweenthepowertransmitted\ntotheantennafeedpointbyasignalcomingfromonespecificdirection(𝜃, 𝜙)andthesamequantity\naveraged over all directions.

Thesetwoarmsexhibit\nsimilarbehavior,withanenhancedsensitivitybelow100MHz,wheremostoftheradiosignalfrom\nEAS is expected, for zenith angles of 60–75◦. At a zenith angle of85◦—closer to the ground—the\ngain remains close to unity for a large part of the 50–200MHz bandwidth, despite stronger ground\nattenuation. The slight difference between the X and Y arms is due to the influence of the solar\npanel placed at the foot of the antenna. Here again, like in Figs. 6 and 7, the Z arm exhibits a\ndifferent behavior, with a gain increasing with zenith angle, as expected, but also with frequency, a\nfeature we understand as a consequence of ground reflections.\nLNA.—Figure 9 shows the two designs of the LNA boards deployed in GP300 and G@A.\nFor GP300, the LNA board was designed to provide a stable gain of about 20 dB in the range of\n50–200 MHz. As shown in Fig. 9, left, in the GP300 board the X and Y paths are connected to the\n– 10 –dipoles and the Z path, to the monopole. When powered with 5 V from the FEB (more on it later),\nthe LNA board draws 47 mA for each channel, leading to a power consumption of about 235 mW\nforthefullboard. AnelectrostaticdischargeprotectionstructureguardstheLNAfromdamagedue\nto static electricity. The balun converts differential signals into single-ended signals and performs\nimpedance transformation. The matching network, located at the front-end of the LNA, converts\nthe impedance to 50Ω, minimizing impedance matching issues at the LNA input port.\nForG@A,theLNAdesignwasfocusedonprovidinghighergainatalowpowerconsumption.\nOur design provides a stable gain of about 30 dB for each of the X, Y, Z channels, in the same\nrange as GP300, 50–200 MHz. The noisier radio environment of G@A compared to GP300 leads\ntoadditionalnoisepickup. Wereitnotforthehigh-gainLNA,thisnoisewouldbeamplifiedbythe\nvariable gain amplifier on the FEB. Like in GP300, the board is powered with 5 V by the GRAND\nFEB; each channel draws 40 mA and the total power consumption of the board is 200 mW. As\nshown in Fig. 9, right, the path lengths for the X, Y, and Z channels in the LNA board are exactly\nthe same, leading to equal signal time delays for all channels. This allows for the study of the\ntime dependence of the polarization in an unbiased way, avoiding additional software corrections\nto the timing of the individual polarization directions. Given the weather conditions in Argentina,\nwe implemented moisture countermeasures to prevent water damage: the nuts are sealed with an\nadditional layer of silicone, and the LNA boards are coated with transparent lacquer.\nThe main differences in the output signals provided by the two designs of the LNA board are\nthe gain and the matching network. For GP300, the LNA has uniform matching across the full\nfrequency range. For G@A model, its matching is optimized for higher frequencies,i.e., above 80\nMHz. The difference in maximum gain for the LNA boards is compensated by the amplifier in the\nGRAND FEB, as described in the next section.\n3.3 Front-end board and firmware\nFigure 10 shows the prototype GRAND FEB used in GP300 and G@A. We describe its primary\ncomponents we below.\nAnalog chain.—The analog chain, component (1) in Fig. 10, serves multiple purposes. First,\nthe analog signals, coming from the LNA, are shaped through a fifth-order elliptical 30–200MHz-\nbandpassfilter. Inthefollowing,theypassthroughthevariablegainamplifier(VGA),whosesetting\niscontrolledbythedigitalpartoftheboard. Thegaincanvarybetween-10and+20dB.InGP300,\nwe use a VGA gain of 20dB; in G@A, we use a 0dB gain. In addition, the analog chain supplies\npower to the front-end LNA boards (Section 3.2) through a bias-T.\nFigure11showsthemeasuredanalogresponseoftheFEBboard. Forthisfigure,theVGAgain\nof the FEB was set at 3 dB before the measurement. The response was then measured to be nearly\nconstant in the GRAND working frequency range of 50–200 MHz, with a value of approximately\n3 dB, indicating that the signal is amplified properly.\nADC chip.—The FEBs digitize the signals after they pass the analog chain. The digitization\nuses a 14-bit 500MSPS, 4-channel analog-to-digital converter (ADC; Analog Devices, AD9694),\ncomponent (2) in Fig. 10, in differential mode with an input voltage range of±0.9V. This setting\nallows us to measure the background noise at around 30 ADC counts, leaving a dynamic range\nof about 9 effective bits. This yields a compromise between accurate noise determination and\n– 11 –Figure 10.The GRAND front-end board (FEB).The main components: (1) signal input and filter chain,\nwith four inputs available; (2) analog-to-digital (ADC) chip; (3) system on chip: field-programmable gate\narray (FPGA) and central processing unit (CPU) ; (4) Global Positioning System (GPS) chip and connector;\n(5)Ethernetchip;(6)clock;(7)powersupplyforthedigitalpartoftheboard;(8)powersupplyfortheanalog\npart of the board; and (9) power connector and switch.

Triggering is elaborated on in in Section 4.\nGPSandslowcontrolparameters.—Aftertriggering,thefirmwarebuildstheevent. Datafrom\nthe three input channels are combined with timing information from the GPS chip (Trimble RES\nSMT360), component (4) in Fig.10, and data from slow control parameters, such as air pressure\nand battery voltage. These are written in an event header, in which all configuration parameters\nare also stored. The local software inside the CPU is notified that an event is present and starts the\ntransfer into the local board memory.\nTriggeringanddatatransfer.—Twofirmwareversionsweretested,oneatGP300andtheother\natG@A.Theydifferinthemethodofdatatransferintomemory.

Given the quieter radio environment\nof GP300, the AXI speed is enough to deal with the trigger rate.\nHowever, the higher trigger rate at the G@A site required a faster memory transfer method.\nTherefore, at G@A, the software uses direct memory access (DMA transfer), moving all parts of\neach triggered event into double data rate (DDR) memory, which has a total size of 512MB. The\nfirmware may then apply a secondary “high-level” trigger algorithm to further reject uninteresting\nevents.

The RF chain receives as input an open-circuit voltage,𝑉oc, which\nemulates the output voltage from the antenna arms. The final output voltage ofGRANDlib,𝑉out,\nis the resulting signal after passing through the matching network, LNA, cables, connectors, and\nFEB. Reference [48] contains more details ofGRANDlib, the RF chain, and its implementation.\nThe implementation of the RF chain inGRANDlibis modular and can be adapted to the\ndifferent setups of GP300 and G@A. The RF chain is described viascattering parameters(S-\nparameters), which quantify the reflection and transmission of the signals as they travel through\nthe different components of a GRAND DU. The S-parameters of GP300 and G@A were measured\nseparately in the laboratory and fed toGRANDlib.\nFigure12showstheresultingsimulatedoverallsystemresponseasafunctionoffrequencyfor\nGP300andG@A.Theresponseisquantifiedviathetransferfunction,definedastheratio𝑉 out/𝑉oc,\n– 14 –measuredwithrespecttothebaseoftheDU(seealsoFig.8inRef.[48]). WithinGP300andG@A,\nthe transfer functions of the X and Y arms are similar to each other and different from the transfer\nfunction of the Z arm, reflecting their VELs (Fig. 6). However, the transfer functions are different\nin GP300 and G@A, primarily because of their different LNAs. Although refinement of the RF\nchain is still ongoing, the results in Fig. 12 already allow us to validate the setups by comparing\nsimulations to measurements of, for example, the Galactic radio background [29].\n3.5 Communications and power supply\nCommunication between the local and central DAQ software is done through TCP/IP sockets for\nboth G@A and GP300. Upon request from the central DAQ, the complete event is sent over the\nwireless network. This network is created through M5 (G@A) or AirMax (GP300)™Ubiquiti\nBullets, Rockets, and a parabolic communications antenna. For G@A these were provided by the\nPierre Auger Collaboration. Bi-directional transmission tests were performed point-to-point,i.e.,\nDU to DAQ, in both arrays, using a fixed file size. The uplink speed, from DU to DAQ, was on\naverage 2.9 MB s−1 for GP300 and 2.1 MB s−1 for G@A. The downlink speed, from DAQ to\nDU, was on average 4.2 MB s−1 for GP300 and 1.1 MB s−1 for G@A. The local and central DAQ\nsoftware pipeline is described in the next section.\nIn both arrays, the power supply of each DU consists of a solar panel, a charge controller, and\na battery. The power consumption of a single DU is roughly 15W. The power supply components\nwerespecifiedtoensuretheDUscanoperateforoneweekonafullbattery,evenwithoutinputfrom\nthesolarpanel. InGP300,thesolarpanelshaveanominalpowerof180W,withamaximumpower\nvoltageof19.5V.Low-noisechargecontrollers(GenasunGV-10-Pb-12V)werechosentoefficiently\ncharge the battery from the solar panel as well as provide power to the FEBs. Cold-resistant gel\nbatteries were selected, operating at a nominal output voltage of 12V with a capacity of 200Ah.\nIn G@A, the AERA electronics compartment and power harvesting were mostly re-used, as\nthe power requirements of the prototype GRAND FEB match the AERA electronics quite closely.\nThesolarpanelwasthesameoriginallydeployedintheAERA-IIstations(Kyocera135W),witha\nnominalpowerof135Wandmaximumoutputvoltageof16V.Newchargecontrollers,ofthesame\nmodelasdeployedatGP300,wereinstalledtoreplacetheoriginalAERAones. Thebatterieswere\nalso exchanged for lead-acid batteries with a nominal output voltage of 12V and 180Ah capacity.\nOverall, the final power supply for G@A has a smaller capacity than for GP300. As a result, G@A\nDUs may need to hibernate during Argentinian winters, depending on their battery levels.\nIn GP300 and G@A, the charge controllers are housed in Faraday cages. To further isolate\nthem from electromagnetic noise, a filter (Spectrum Control 1250-054) was added to the output\nof the charge controller. The Bullet is also housed in the FEB box at G@A, and, due to the\nheat-dissipation modifications, in a separate Faraday cage at GP300.\n4 Self-trigger and data acquisition\n4.1 Self-trigger algorithm\nThe main science case of GRAND—the study of ultra-high-energy particles [1]—involves the\ndetection of extensive air showers. The radio emission from air showers induces a temporary\n– 15 –Figure13.LocalTriggerflowforanincomingsignalataGRANDdetectionunit.Thetriggeralgorithm\nstarts when the amplitude of the signal exceeds the preset “signal threshold\",i.e., when a signal crossing\nhappens, as long as there was no such crossing in the preceding quiet time window. In the time period\nfollowing the signal crossing, called the “trigger period window”, the algorithm counts the number of\ncrossings of a lower “noise threshold\". If the number of noise-threshold crossings is between predefined\nallowed minimum and maximum values, and the time interval between any two adjacent noise-threshold\ncrossings does not exceed a predefined maximum value, the trigger process is completed and the signal is\naccepted. Because the trigger logic runs under the 500-MHz clock in the FPGA, the timing has a resolution\nof 2 ns. The time stamp, corresponding to the time of the end of the trigger period window, is recorded and\nit is sent to the Central DAQ.\ndistortion of the local electric field, with a duration of several nanoseconds. Through the data\nacquisition chain described above, this distortion is translated into a short transient in the voltage\ninputtotheADC.However,anthropogenicsourcesalsoemitradiopulseswithsimilarcharacteristics.\nThus, air-shower experiments that rely solely on their radio-detection, like the GRAND prototype\narrays, must have a self-triggering procedure that selects only detected events that resemble those\nexpected from air showers.\nThe detected radio pulse emitted by an air shower generates a short-duration, high-amplitude\n(relative to the average baseline) oscillation in the FEB output. Man-made noise usually creates\na wider pulse or a train of pulses. In addition, constructive interference of single-frequency\nanthropogenic sources can also create air shower-like pulses. The Local Trigger happens at the\nDU level and is implemented within the firmware running on the FPGA chip. Its aim is to select\nair-shower candidates while rejecting background pulses by efficiently identifying peaks in the\ndifferenceoftwoconsecutiveADCsamples. WiththeprototypeGRANDFEB,itispossibletofirst\nremove single-frequency noise sources with a digital filter, as shown in Section 3.3. The resulting\nfiltered signal is fed to the trigger algorithm.\nFigure 13 shows a representative flowchart of the trigger algorithm, which begins with a\nconfigurable “signal threshold”. If the signal exceeds this threshold and there has not been any\nthreshold crossing in a time window prior to the current pulse, the algorithm starts. The signal\n– 16 –threshold is set to a value that is suitably higher than the average noise level, while maintaining a\nreasonable trigger rate. The second of these conditions aims to avoid pulse trains. Next, in a time\nwindow after the pulse, the system counts how many times a second “noise threshold” is crossed.\nThe width of the time windows, the signal and noise threshold levels, the allowed maximum\nnumber of crossings of the noise threshold, and the maximum time between successive crossings\nare adjustable parameters. They are set offline at the Central DAQ prior to each data acquisition\nrun. The values are chosen to best reject long and/or irregular pulse trains, and to prevent digital\nglitchesfromcorruptingthevoltagetraces. Thistriggerflexibilityallowsustoadapttothedifferent\nnoise environments of each array, with G@A requiring stricter settings to avoid the more frequent\nnarrow and broadband radio frequency interference (RFI). When all triggering conditions are met,\nthe Local Trigger is complete and the timestamp is sent to the Central DAQ.\nNext to recording air showers, the arrays also keep track of the background conditions via\nunbiasedtriggering. This corresponds to periodically recorded data, independent of the measured\nvoltage levels. Such unbiased data are suitable for monitoring the environment and for calibrating\nthe setups using the periodic variation of the Galactic noise, which is currently ongoing [30, 36].\nUnbiased data can also be used for additional science cases like measuring fast radio bursts [48].\nUnbiased triggering, by default, takes place once every 10 s (a pre-defined 20-Hz mode is also\navailable). In the G@A firmware version, it is possible to set the unbiased triggering frequency\nbetween 1Hz and 100kHz. GP300 and G@A perform both transient and unbiased triggering.\nAchievingahighself-triggerperformanceiskeytothesuccessofastandaloneradio-detection\nexperimentsuchasGRAND.Theachievedtriggerrateasafunctionoftheincomingrateoftransient\npulses is of particular importance.

Unbiased triggered events bypass the Local Trigger at the\nFPGA but still go through the same DAQ pipeline. See Section 4 for details.\nanditsevent-buildingprocess. Thisprocesscombinesallinformationintoasingleeventandwrites\nthe data to the local disk. All coincident transient triggered data that satisfy the Central Trigger are\nrecorded incoincident data(CD) binary files.\nFurthermore, a random selection of local transient triggered events can be promoted to a\nCentral Trigger and be saved as well. These events have no coincidences with other DUs and are\nusedtomonitorthetriggeralgorithmandthenoiseenvironment. Theyarestoredseparatelyinunit\ndata(UD) binary files. Unbiased triggers are always promoted to Central triggers and are saved in\nmonitoringdata (MD) files.\n5 Data storage\nThe final data files of each trigger type—CD, UD, and MD—are saved on the local storage of the\nCentral DAQ computer in GP300 and G@A. For GP300, the binary files are sent in real time to a\ncomputercenterinNanjing,China,throughawirelessbridge. Thefilesarethenmanuallymovedto\nthe CC-IN2P3 cluster in Lyon, France. For G@A, new files on disk are copied daily to the central\nstorage in CC-IN2P3 using the 4G network. This copying does not interfere with the data-taking\nor the bandwidth used by the Pierre Auger Collaboration. In case of high RFI conditions or failed\noff-site data transfer, the DAQ computer has enough memory to store all data.\nThe automatic copying requires a local bash script to run automatically (i.e., acronjob) on\nthe central computer for G@A and semi-manually for GP300. This script first searches for files\nnot already transferred to CC-IN2P3 and stores this list in a simple local SQLite database. This\n– 18 –database is used to keep track of previously transferred files and to determine if a file needs to be\nsent. Afterwards,thenewdatafilesarerelayedtothecorrespondingdirectoriesonCC-IN2P3using\nrsyncand then flagged into the local SQLite database.\nWhen data dispatch is finalized, a second script is triggered in CC-IN2P3 that registers all\nnewly transferred files in the main database and launches the conversion into the GRANDRoot\nformat, described in Ref. [48]. The GRANDRoot files are moved to the corresponding directories\nand registered in the main database.\n6 Data quality monitoring\nTo ensure adequate data quality during the deployment and commissioning phases of GP300 and\nG@A,afewkeyparametersaretrackedineveryDU.Aspreviouslystated,acompleteeventconsists\nofthetriggeredADCtimetracesandtheslowcontrolparameters,likethebatterylevelattheboard\ninput, the GPS, and, in G@A alone, the ADC and FPGA chip temperatures and the trigger rate.\nThrough the unbiased triggered data, these parameters can be continuously monitored. Their\nbehaviorwasusednotonlytocommissionthearraysbutalsotovalidatethefirmwareandthelocal\nand central DAQ software. Other features—such as their root mean square (RMS), fast Fourier\ntransform, and power spectral densities (PSDs)—are extracted from the ADC traces in the time\ndomain to monitor day-night effects and detect local radio transients. Particularly, the PSDs can\nbe used to characterize the environment radio background, the electronic noise self-induced by the\nsetup, the Galactic radio background, and the RFI. These parameters are checked daily to ensure\noptimal operation of the setups. We monitor their behavior over time, comparing them between\nDUs to achieve consistent data quality across the array.\nThe commissioning is facilitated by a data monitoring web page. The page is updated daily at\n05:00CET,byacrontabjobthatrunsaseriesofscriptsatCC-IN2P3onthedatafrombotharrays.\nThe DU uptime, the mean RMS of the last 24 hours of traces, battery levels, and temperatures\nare tracked as a function of time. Averaged PSDs are also displayed for easy comparison between\nchannels and between DUs. The page also stores the averages over the last 7 days and the last 30\ndays. There is flexibility to present the data of all DUs together or of only the desired ones.\n7 First results\nGP300andG@Ahaveoperatedforabouttwoyearssincetheendoftheirdeployment(withGP300\nchanging from comprising 13 to 65 DUs). Throughout this period, enough unbiased triggered data\nwascollectedtocharacterizetheperformanceoftheDUsandthelocalelectromagneticenvironment.\nThese studies were performed in the frequency domain, where the complete antenna readout chain\nisbetterunderstoodandbackgroundsourcescanbeidentified. Inaddition,astheDUsaredeployed\nrelatively close together, working in the frequency domain allowed us to verify that all of them\nshowed similar response, which is needed to understand the relative calibration between DUs.\nFigure 15 shows spectrograms generated using data collected by two DUs, one from GP300\nandonefromG@A,overaperiodofaboutnineandthirteendays,respectively. Thesespectrograms\nare representative of the standard behavior of all DUs in their respective arrays.\n– 19 –Power spectrum density [mV² MHz⁻¹]\n10⁻⁴ 10⁻³ 10⁻² 10⁻¹ 10⁰ 10¹ 10² 10³\nGRAND@AugerGRANDProto300\nNorth-South\nEast-West\nVertical\nNorth-South\nEast-West\nVertical\nFigure 15.Spectrograms measured by GRAND detection units.Each row shows spectrograms for a dif-\nferent antenna polarization: North-South (top), East-West (center), and vertical (bottom).

Of the intermittent contributions,\none at around 70 MHz can be seen in all polarizations, where there is an increase of amplitude for\na few hours with no clear periodicity. In the North-South polarization, the four lines within 60–80\nMHz correspond to the known emission of the AERA beacon, set up at the CRS (see Fig. 2).\nIn Fig. 15, the white horizontal lines represent periods of DU hibernation, after which data\nacquisition resumes autonomously once the conditions are appropriate. The G@A DU had more\nhibernation periods than the GP300 DU, a reflection of the harsher environment in Argentina,\nleading to more periods with insufficient sunlight to power the batteries and more instances of\noverheating. In general, the radio environment at GP300 is considerably quieter than at G@A,\nbut wide background-free frequency bands exist at both sites. Nevertheless, the background in\nseveral frequency ranges is substantial and can negatively influence the self-trigger capabilities of\nthe system, especially in G@A.\nFigure 16 shows the time-averaged PSDs of GP300 and G@A, where the background noise\n– 21 –contributions can be more clearly seen. For GP300, the PSD is mostly free of peaks, except in the\n118–140MHzrange—inagreementwithFig.15—wheretherearestrongcontributionsfromplane\nandsatellitecommunications.

In particular, the G@A PSD characterizes the electromagnetic background at the Pierre\nAuger site at frequencies much higher than either AERA or the Auger Radio Detector are capable\nof measuring. This can aid and complement analyses of the Pierre Auger Collaboration—another\nexample of the synergy between the Pierre Auger Observatory and GRAND.\nFigures 15 and 16 show that, while radio background is unavoidable in both arrays, it is\nlocalized within frequency ranges that can be isolated and masked out in specific analyses. For\ninstance,searchesforthediffuseGalacticradioemissionrequirenoise-freefrequencyranges,dueto\ntheloweremissionamplitudeofthisbackgroundcomparedtoartificialradiosources. Thissearchis\nongoing in both prototype arrays [29, 30], since it presents an opportunity for detector calibration.\nThe above results show that the radio background at both sites is understood. At the GP300\nsite, there are fewer RFI sources compared to the G@A site. The baseline levels of the PSDs are\nthe same for both prototype arrays, around10−2 mV2 MHz−1. In summary, early data from the\nGRAND prototype arrays already validate their usefulness: that,despite differences in hardware\nand software, the overall response of the GRAND DU is consistent regardless of the deployment\nsite.This is a structural finding for future cross-calibration runs and for the later stages of the\nexperiment, which envision two or more 10,000-DU arrays deployed at different geographical\nlocations, and whose data will be analyzed jointly.\n8 Summary and perspectives\nThe Giant Radio Array for Neutrino Detection (GRAND) is a planned observatory of ultra-high-\nenergy particles of cosmic origin: cosmic rays, neutrinos, and gamma rays. GRAND aims to\ndetect the radio emission from air showers initiated by their interaction in the atmosphere using\nlarge ground arrays of antennas. The next large deployment goal of GRAND is to have two arrays\nconsistingof10,000antennaseachintheNorthernandSouthernHemispheres. Toachievethis,the\nGRANDCollaborationhasadoptedastagedapproachtodeployment,withthreeongoingprototype\narrays to test and validate the detection and reconstruction methods.\nThree prototype arrays were deployed in 2023. GRAND@Nançay, in France, is a 4-antenna\narrayusedasatestbenchfortheCollaboration’sEuropeanlaboratories. GRANDProto300,inChina,\nhasgonethroughtwostagesofdeployment,fromaninitial13-antennastagetoitscurrent65-antenna\nstage. These stages act as pathfinders for the future final 300-antenna array. GRAND@Auger, in\nArgentina, stems from an agreement between the GRAND and the Pierre Auger Collaborations.\nThe 10-antenna array was deployed on modified AERA stations. In this paper, we focused on the\nhardware, software, and early operation of GRANDProto300 and GRAND@Auger.\nTo adapt to local conditions and explore optimal designs for the final GRAND setup, the\nprototype array at each site featured different key choices in hardware and software. Throughout\n2023, the arrays, including their hardware, firmware, and DAQ software, were commissioned\nusing daily data monitoring. Operating these prototypes under prolonged field conditions exposed\nhardware and software challenges that have been met.\n– 23 –GRANDProto300andGRAND@Augerhaveremainedlargelyoperationalforabouttwoyears.\nTheir data have been analyzed and understood. We have shown results based on these data that\ndemonstrate the adequacy of the GRAND experimental setup and provide an understanding of the\nradiobackgroundpresentateachsite. ThedetectionoftheGalacticradioemission—thesearchfor\nwhich is ongoing in both prototypes—will refine the calibration of the GRAND detection units.\nTheGRANDprototypeshavealreadyyieldedakeyresult: thattheperformanceoftheGRAND\ndetection units is similar at the two array sites, despite one having a radio background notably\nhigher than the other, and despite their differences in hardware and software. The demonstrated\nresilience of the GRAND DU is not merely a technical achievement; it is a foundational scientific\nresult for the entire project. A future stage of GRAND consisting of arrays distributed in multiple\ngeographicallocationswillinevitablyfacediverseenvironmentalandradio-backgroundconditions.\nOur finding that consistent performance can be achieved through adaptable hardware and software\nconfirms the feasibility of combining data from geographically distant arrays. This is essential for\nachieving the full-sky coverage and large-scale exposure of future stages of GRAND.\nThe ultimate goal of GRANDProto300 and GRAND@Auger is to validate the autonomous\nradio-detection of inclined extensive air showers in GRAND, expected from ultra-high-energy\ncosmic rays, neutrinos, and gamma rays. This detection, triggered by no signal other than radio,\nand with a high efficiency, is essential to the goals of GRAND. Presently, the data collected by\nGRANDProto300 and GRAND@Auger are being searched for air showers initiated by ultra-high-\nenergy cosmic rays. In GRANDProto300, we have identified the first cosmic-ray candidates [38–\n43]. In GRAND@Auger, the detection of cosmic-ray candidates is being validated through their\ncoincident detection by the Pierre Auger Observatory [47].\nAcknowledgments\nThe GRAND Collaboration acknowledges the significant contributions to this manuscript of Beat-\nriz de Errico, for her work on data management and analysis, site survey and construction, DAQ\nsoftwaredebugging,manuscriptwriting,andfigurepreparation;andofShenWang,forhisworkon\nGP300sitesurveyandconstruction,hardwareverification,andmanuscriptplanningandwriting.

    "combined_content": "Abstract Content:\nThe Giant Radio Array for Neutrino Detection (GRAND) is a proposed\nmulti-messenger observatory of ultra-high-energy (UHE) particles of cosmic\norigin. Its main goal is to find the long-sought origin of UHE cosmic rays by\ndetecting large numbers of them and the secondary particles created by their\ninteraction -- gamma rays, and, especially, neutrinos. GRAND will do so using\nlarge arrays of radio antennas that look for the radio signals emitted by the\nair showers initiated by the interactions of the UHE particles in the\natmosphere. Since 2023, three small-scale prototype GRAND arrays have been in\noperation: GRAND@Nan\\c{c}ay in France, GRAND@Auger in Argentina, and\nGRANDProto300 in China. Together, their goal is to validate the detection\nprinciple of GRAND under prolonged field conditions, achieving efficient,\nautonomous radio-detection of air showers. We describe the hardware, software,\nlayout, and operation of the GRAND prototypes and show the first radio spectra\nmeasured by them. Despite challenges, the successful operation of the\nprototypes confirms that the GRAND instrumentation is apt to address the goals\nof the experiment and lays the groundwork for its ensuing stages.\n\nPDF Content:\nPrepared for submission to JINST\nTowards the Giant Radio Array for Neutrino Detection\n(GRAND): the GRANDProto300 and GRAND@Auger\nprototypes\nGR D\nN\nGRAND Collaboration\nJ.

Its ultimate goal is to provide crucial evidence that addresses the long-standing question of\nthe origin of UHE cosmic rays (UHECRs) [2–4]. GRAND plans to do so, directly, by detecting a\nvast number of UHECRs and, indirectly, by detecting the secondary gamma rays and, especially,\nthe UHE neutrinos made by the interaction of UHECRs [5]. To achieve this, GRAND plans to use\nlarge arrays of radio antennas that search for the distinctive radio signals emitted by the extensive\nair showers initiated by UHE particles interacting in the atmosphere [6, 7].\nThe radio-detection of UHECRs is a mature technique. It has been demonstrated in past\nand present detectors using overground antenna arrays [6, 7] by the Auger Engineering Radio\nArray (AERA) [8], the Low-Frequency Array (LOFAR) [9], the Taiwan Astroparticle Radiowave\nObservatory for Geo-synchrotron Emissions (TAROGE) [10], and the Tianshan Radio Experiment\nfor Neutrino Detection (TREND) [11]; using underground arrays [12] by the Askaryan Radio\nArray (ARA) [13] and the Antarctic Ross Ice Shelf Antenna Neutrino Array (ARIANNA) [14];\n– 1 –GRAND@Auger\n10 antennas\nMalargüe, Argentina\nLook for coincident\ndetection with Auger\nGRAND@Nançay\n4 antennas\nNançay, France\nFor testbenching\nGRANDProto300\n13     65 (now)      300 antennas⇢→\nDunhuang, China\nEstablish efficient autonomous\nradio-detection of air showers\nFigure 1.The GRAND prototype arrays.The three GRAND prototype arrays were deployed in 2023 and\nhave been in operation since.

Concurrent\nwith GRAND, the new Radio Detector of the AugerPrime upgrade [16], the upcoming Payload\nfor Ultrahigh Energy Observations (PUEO) [17], and the proposed next-generation Beamforming\nElevated Array for COsmic Neutrinos (BEACON) [18] and Radar Echo Telescope (RET-CR) [19]\nalso target the radio-detection of UHE particles, though adopting different, complementary [20]\ndetection strategies. References [21–23] present an overview of upcoming UHE detectors.\nBuilding on the experience gained by these experiments—most directly, by AERA and\nTREND—GRANDplanstodeployantennaarraysatalargerscale[1,24]. Thisinvolvesincreasing\nthe number of antennas deployed—to eventually tens of thousands—and deploying them in arrays\nthat are sparser than before—with km-scale antenna separations. This up-scaling is requisite for\nthe antenna arrays to monitor the large volumes of the atmosphere needed to deliver vast numbers\nofdetectedUHECRs[1]andasensitivitytoeventinyfluxesofUHEneutrinos[1,21–23,25]. The\nGRAND Collaboration plans to achieve this while keeping its carbon footprint low [26].\nSuch an enterprise involves facing technical challenges that, while significant, are surmount-\nable. To face them, GRAND is to be built with a staged construction plan [1, 27, 28] designed to\nvalidatethedesignandoperationoftheexperimentinsmallerscalesbeforedeployinglargerarrays.\nFigure 1 shows the locations of the GRAND prototypes, in operation since 2023 [28]:\nGRAND@Nançayin Nançay, France,GRANDProto300[29] in Dunhuang, China, andGRAND\n@Auger[30]inMalargüe,Argentina,atthesiteofthePierreAugerObservatory(PierreAuger)[31].\nTheir purpose is to validate two core requirements that GRAND must fulfill to achieve its goals.\nFirst, the prototypes must validate the viability of autonomous radio-detection of air showers\nin a sparse radio array [32–35], unaided by particle detectors, and despite the presence of natural\nand anthropogenic radio background that may mimic the radio signatures expected from showers.\n– 2 –Second, the prototypes must validate that the arrays are able to operate under harsh environmental\nfield conditions—high temperature, sandstorms, rainstorms—for prolonged periods of time. The\nlessons garnered from the prototypes will inform the design of the experiment in later stages.\nInthispaper,weintroducethedesignandoperationoftheGRANDprototypearrays,focusing\non the two larger ones, GRANDProto300 (GP300) and GRAND@Auger (G@A). In addition,\nwe present the first results obtained by them during their first two years of operation: the time-\ndependent and time-averaged radio spectra measured by them, including identified sources of\nradio background.The ongoing operation of the arrays—though not devoid of challenges—\ncoupled with their early-data results, validate the resilience of the GRAND design to adapt to\ndifferent environmental conditions, a requirement to pursue future, larger stages of GRAND.\nThis constitutes the basis for demonstrating the autonomous detection of cosmic rays in GRAND,\nwhich will be shown in future publications (see Ref. [35] for preliminary results).\nTheremainderofthepaperisorganizedasfollows. Section2introducestheGRANDprototype\narrays, their sites, and layouts. Section 3 describes the GRAND detection unit, its hardware,\nsoftware, and performance. Section 4 presents the self-trigger algorithm of the experiment and\nthe data acquisition software. Section 5 describes the data transfer pipeline, from local and central\nstorage on-site to permanent storage off-site. Section 6 presents the offline data-quality monitoring\ntoolsoftheexperiment. Section7showsthefirstradiospectraobservedbytheGRANDprototypes,\nincluding identified background sources. Section 8 summarizes and concludes.\n2 Overview of the GRAND prototype arrays\nThe site and array layout for each GRAND prototype were decided to fulfill their specific goals:\ntestbenching for GRAND@Nançay, demonstrating the autonomous radio-detection of air showers\nfor GP300, and observing coincident detection of air showers with the Pierre Auger detectors in\nG@A.Theradiobackgroundvariesbetweensites,withthebackgroundatGRAND@Nançaybeing\nthe loudest, and the background at GP300 being appreciably smaller than at G@A, predominantly\ndue to GP300 being farther from human activity.\nGRAND@Nançay.—GRAND@NançayisasmallarrayoffourGRANDdetectionunits(DUs,\nSection 3) located at the Nançay Radio Observatory, in France. It was conceived as a field site\naccessibletoEuropeanlaboratories,facilitatingtestbenchingofequipmentandnewideasindesign,\ntrigger, and data acquisition. The design of GRAND@Nançay resembles that of the other two\nprototype arrays, though with notable differences, such as having antennas of lower height and\ncommunications via optical fiber instead of wireless. Due to its small size, it serves primarily as a\ntestbed. In the remainder of the paper, we focus on GRANDProto300 and GRAND@Auger.\nGRANDProto300.—GP300 is the pathfinder array for GRAND in the Northern Hemisphere.\nIn its final stage, it will be a 300-antenna array; presently, it exists in partial configurations.\nThe 300-antenna stage of GP300 will span an area of about 200 km2 in the Gobi Desert near\nXiaodushan, in northern Dunhuang, China, making it the largest of the three prototypes. The site\nis a largely radio-quiet region in the 50–200 MHz radio-frequency band, which GRAND adopts as\nits working frequency band. The precise location was chosen after a survey of regions that contain\na relatively flat area capable of hosting the final 300-antenna stage of GP300, and that was located\n– 3 –□4000 □3000 □2000 □1000 0 1000 2000\nx [m]\n□2000\n□1000\n0\n1000\n2000\n3000\n4000\n5000\ny [m]\n10\n1\n8\n11\n6\n2\n9\n12\n3\n7\n4\n5\n13\n119\n116\n106\n93\n102\n91\n81\n78\n88\n47\n44\n85\n43\n37\n40\n82\n55\n31\n28\n52\n15\n20\n23\n35\n11\n8\n32\n48\n19\n51\n7\n16\n5\n27\n2\n24\n13\n39\n1\n12\n38\n4\n3\n25\n26\n50\n18\n49\n6\n17\n10\n9\n33\n34\n22\n14\n21\n54\n30\n29\n53\n42\n36\n41\n46\n45\nCS1\nCS2\nCS: Central Station\nGRANDProto300\ndetection units\nGP300 s65 (Apr 25–present)\nGP300 s13 (Jun 23–Apr 25)\n□26000 □25500 □25000 □24500\nx [m]\n14600\n14800\n15000\n15200\n15400\n15600\n15800\n16000\nCRS\n35 36\n135\n44\n5\n9\n25\n27\n82\n136 137\n146145\n152\n85 157\n58\n49\n69\n59\n83\n70\n144\n60\n84\n151\nAccess road\nCRS: Central Radio Station\nGRAND@Auger detection unit\nAERA station\nN\nFigure 2.Array layout of GRANDProto300 (left) and of GRAND@Auger (right).Each GRAND\ndetection unit (DU) has an assigned identification number.

For GRANDProto300, the DUs from the 13-antenna stage, GP300_s13, were repositioned as\npart of the 65-antenna stage, GP300_s65, in May of 2025, and the original Central Station 1 (CS1) was\nreplacedbythenewCS2.

By April of 2025, the array was extended to its current\n65-antenna stage, GP300_s65, which has been operating since and whose additional goals include\ntesting the efficiency and purity of the detection of inclined air showers from UHECRs. GP300,\neven in partial configuration, is expected to detect UHECRs with energies between 100PeV and a\nfew EeV, probing the Galactic to extragalactic transition region of cosmic ray origin.\nFigure2showsthelayoutofGP300_s13andGP300_s65.

A hexagonal array has fewer\ndirections along which the performance of shower-reconstruction methods is degraded as a result\nof the shower trajectory being aligned with the axes of symmetry of the array layout.\nGP300_s13 had a three-hexagon layout, covering an area of about 2 km2 with a DU spacing\nof about 500 m. The Central Station 1 (CS1) was built north-west of the array; it consisted of\nthree sets of container rooms that stored the central data acquisition (DAQ) computer and the\nlodgingandcookingfacilities.

The array has a dense region to the east with a DU\nspacing of 577 m and a sparse region to the west with a spacing of 1000 m. A new Central Station\n(CS2) was built for GP300_s65 and placed at its center.\nPreliminary simulations [37] estimate that the full GP300 array may detect about 130 inclined\ncosmic-rayeventsperday—foranideal100%uptimeofthedetector—intheenergyrangeof10 17–\n1020 eV, reaching a trigger efficiency of 90% already at1018.3 eV.

Although the search for these cosmic rays is\ncomplicated by firmware and DAQ changes made during prototype testing, it has already yielded\nits first likely candidates in GP300_s65 data [38–40].\nGRAND@Auger.—G@A results from an agreement between the GRAND and Pierre Auger\nCollaborations to repurpose 10 AERA radio-stations in Malargüe, Argentina, into GRAND DUs.\nThedeploymentofG@AwascompletedinAugustof2023andithasbeenoperatingsince.

Ten of the AERA Phase-2 stations were modified into GRAND\nDUs. The DUs are laid on two superimposed hexagons with a predominant spacing of 250 m,\ncovering an area of 0.5 km2. The G@A central DAQ computer is located in the AERA Central\nRadio Station (CRS). Nearby roads facilitate access to the site.\nFor G@A, using a denser detector layout enhances the detection of less energetic and less\ninclined events.

In the following sections, we discuss the\ncharacteristics of the antenna, LNAs, the GRAND FEB, power supply, and communications setup.\n3.2 Antenna and low-noise amplifier\nAntenna.—Figure 5, left, shows that the antenna itself consists of five arms: two dipoles in the\nNorth-South and East-West directions, and a monopole in the vertical direction. The dipole size is\nroughly 1.4 m, to match the GRAND working frequency band of 50–200 MHz. Figure 5, right,\nshows the acrylic nut with an internal connector to which the antenna arms are attached. The LNA\nboard is housed in the metal base of the nut and is powered by a coaxial cable that also transports\nreceived signals to the FEB.\nFigure6showsthesimulatedresponseoftheGRANDHorizonAntennatoanincomingradio\nsignal, expressed in the form of the magnitude of the vector effective length (VEL),Leff.

[48].\nFor theHorizonAntenna, the VEL was simulated using the Ansys HFSS (high-frequency\nstructure simulator) program, with a setup that included the complete mechanical structure of the\nDU. The resulting VEL is an elaborate function of frequency, zenith, and azimuth angle that fully\ncharacterizes the response of the antenna to an arbitrary incoming plane-wave signal; see Fig. 5\nin Ref. [48]. This is an essential ingredient to produce simulated measurements and interpret real\nones.

Given the complexity of the VEL of theHorizonAntenna, its validation in\nthe field remains to be completed; a calibration campaign is planned to verify our simulations.\nFigure7showsthegroupdelayoftheHorizonAntenna,i.e.,thederivativewithrespecttothe\nfrequencyofthephaseshiftofthetransferfunctionoftheDU(Section3.4). Avaryinggroupdelay\nthroughout the working frequency range can lead to signal dispersion and loss of amplitude due to\ninterference effects.

For theHorizonAntenna,\n– 9 –Figure 9.Low-noise amplifier (LNA) board deployed at GRANDProto300 (left) and GRAND@Auger\n(right).The main components of the boards are: (1) connectors to the antenna, (2) balun, (3) matching\nnetwork, (4) amplifier, and (5) power. Although the components are in similar locations, their specifications\nare not the same in both boards. See Section 3.2 for details.\nthe group delay is nearly flat in frequency for the three antenna arms, with differences well below\n20 ns that do not significantly distort the expected pulse shape. Given the frequency bandwidth of\n200 MHz, group delay variations smaller than its inverse (5 ns) are acceptable. While there are\nsharp peaksin thegroup delay, they arenarrow enough tohave onlya small effecton signalpower.\nThe antenna responseis embedded in theGRANDlibprocessing pipeline [48] (Section 3.4) andis\nused in the reconstruction of the properties of showers detected by GRAND.\nFigure8showsthegainoftheHorizonAntenna,i.e.,theratiobetweenthepowertransmitted\ntotheantennafeedpointbyasignalcomingfromonespecificdirection(𝜃, 𝜙)andthesamequantity\naveraged over all directions.

At a zenith angle of85◦—closer to the ground—the\ngain remains close to unity for a large part of the 50–200MHz bandwidth, despite stronger ground\nattenuation. The slight difference between the X and Y arms is due to the influence of the solar\npanel placed at the foot of the antenna. Here again, like in Figs. 6 and 7, the Z arm exhibits a\ndifferent behavior, with a gain increasing with zenith angle, as expected, but also with frequency, a\nfeature we understand as a consequence of ground reflections.\nLNA.—Figure 9 shows the two designs of the LNA boards deployed in GP300 and G@A.\nFor GP300, the LNA board was designed to provide a stable gain of about 20 dB in the range of\n50–200 MHz. As shown in Fig. 9, left, in the GP300 board the X and Y paths are connected to the\n– 10 –dipoles and the Z path, to the monopole. When powered with 5 V from the FEB (more on it later),\nthe LNA board draws 47 mA for each channel, leading to a power consumption of about 235 mW\nforthefullboard. AnelectrostaticdischargeprotectionstructureguardstheLNAfromdamagedue\nto static electricity. The balun converts differential signals into single-ended signals and performs\nimpedance transformation. The matching network, located at the front-end of the LNA, converts\nthe impedance to 50Ω, minimizing impedance matching issues at the LNA input port.\nForG@A,theLNAdesignwasfocusedonprovidinghighergainatalowpowerconsumption.\nOur design provides a stable gain of about 30 dB for each of the X, Y, Z channels, in the same\nrange as GP300, 50–200 MHz. The noisier radio environment of G@A compared to GP300 leads\ntoadditionalnoisepickup. Wereitnotforthehigh-gainLNA,thisnoisewouldbeamplifiedbythe\nvariable gain amplifier on the FEB. Like in GP300, the board is powered with 5 V by the GRAND\nFEB; each channel draws 40 mA and the total power consumption of the board is 200 mW. As\nshown in Fig. 9, right, the path lengths for the X, Y, and Z channels in the LNA board are exactly\nthe same, leading to equal signal time delays for all channels. This allows for the study of the\ntime dependence of the polarization in an unbiased way, avoiding additional software corrections\nto the timing of the individual polarization directions. Given the weather conditions in Argentina,\nwe implemented moisture countermeasures to prevent water damage: the nuts are sealed with an\nadditional layer of silicone, and the LNA boards are coated with transparent lacquer.\nThe main differences in the output signals provided by the two designs of the LNA board are\nthe gain and the matching network. For GP300, the LNA has uniform matching across the full\nfrequency range. For G@A model, its matching is optimized for higher frequencies,i.e., above 80\nMHz. The difference in maximum gain for the LNA boards is compensated by the amplifier in the\nGRAND FEB, as described in the next section.\n3.3 Front-end board and firmware\nFigure 10 shows the prototype GRAND FEB used in GP300 and G@A. We describe its primary\ncomponents we below.\nAnalog chain.—The analog chain, component (1) in Fig. 10, serves multiple purposes. First,\nthe analog signals, coming from the LNA, are shaped through a fifth-order elliptical 30–200MHz-\nbandpassfilter. Inthefollowing,theypassthroughthevariablegainamplifier(VGA),whosesetting\niscontrolledbythedigitalpartoftheboard. Thegaincanvarybetween-10and+20dB.InGP300,\nwe use a VGA gain of 20dB; in G@A, we use a 0dB gain. In addition, the analog chain supplies\npower to the front-end LNA boards (Section 3.2) through a bias-T.\nFigure11showsthemeasuredanalogresponseoftheFEBboard. Forthisfigure,theVGAgain\nof the FEB was set at 3 dB before the measurement. The response was then measured to be nearly\nconstant in the GRAND working frequency range of 50–200 MHz, with a value of approximately\n3 dB, indicating that the signal is amplified properly.\nADC chip.—The FEBs digitize the signals after they pass the analog chain. The digitization\nuses a 14-bit 500MSPS, 4-channel analog-to-digital converter (ADC; Analog Devices, AD9694),\ncomponent (2) in Fig. 10, in differential mode with an input voltage range of±0.9V. This setting\nallows us to measure the background noise at around 30 ADC counts, leaving a dynamic range\nof about 9 effective bits. This yields a compromise between accurate noise determination and\n– 11 –Figure 10.The GRAND front-end board (FEB).The main components: (1) signal input and filter chain,\nwith four inputs available; (2) analog-to-digital (ADC) chip; (3) system on chip: field-programmable gate\narray (FPGA) and central processing unit (CPU) ; (4) Global Positioning System (GPS) chip and connector;\n(5)Ethernetchip;(6)clock;(7)powersupplyforthedigitalpartoftheboard;(8)powersupplyfortheanalog\npart of the board; and (9) power connector and switch.

Triggering is elaborated on in in Section 4.\nGPSandslowcontrolparameters.—Aftertriggering,thefirmwarebuildstheevent. Datafrom\nthe three input channels are combined with timing information from the GPS chip (Trimble RES\nSMT360), component (4) in Fig.10, and data from slow control parameters, such as air pressure\nand battery voltage. These are written in an event header, in which all configuration parameters\nare also stored. The local software inside the CPU is notified that an event is present and starts the\ntransfer into the local board memory.\nTriggeringanddatatransfer.—Twofirmwareversionsweretested,oneatGP300andtheother\natG@A.Theydifferinthemethodofdatatransferintomemory.

Given the quieter radio environment\nof GP300, the AXI speed is enough to deal with the trigger rate.\nHowever, the higher trigger rate at the G@A site required a faster memory transfer method.\nTherefore, at G@A, the software uses direct memory access (DMA transfer), moving all parts of\neach triggered event into double data rate (DDR) memory, which has a total size of 512MB. The\nfirmware may then apply a secondary “high-level” trigger algorithm to further reject uninteresting\nevents.

The RF chain receives as input an open-circuit voltage,𝑉oc, which\nemulates the output voltage from the antenna arms. The final output voltage ofGRANDlib,𝑉out,\nis the resulting signal after passing through the matching network, LNA, cables, connectors, and\nFEB. Reference [48] contains more details ofGRANDlib, the RF chain, and its implementation.\nThe implementation of the RF chain inGRANDlibis modular and can be adapted to the\ndifferent setups of GP300 and G@A. The RF chain is described viascattering parameters(S-\nparameters), which quantify the reflection and transmission of the signals as they travel through\nthe different components of a GRAND DU. The S-parameters of GP300 and G@A were measured\nseparately in the laboratory and fed toGRANDlib.\nFigure12showstheresultingsimulatedoverallsystemresponseasafunctionoffrequencyfor\nGP300andG@A.Theresponseisquantifiedviathetransferfunction,definedastheratio𝑉 out/𝑉oc,\n– 14 –measuredwithrespecttothebaseoftheDU(seealsoFig.8inRef.[48]). WithinGP300andG@A,\nthe transfer functions of the X and Y arms are similar to each other and different from the transfer\nfunction of the Z arm, reflecting their VELs (Fig. 6). However, the transfer functions are different\nin GP300 and G@A, primarily because of their different LNAs. Although refinement of the RF\nchain is still ongoing, the results in Fig. 12 already allow us to validate the setups by comparing\nsimulations to measurements of, for example, the Galactic radio background [29].\n3.5 Communications and power supply\nCommunication between the local and central DAQ software is done through TCP/IP sockets for\nboth G@A and GP300. Upon request from the central DAQ, the complete event is sent over the\nwireless network. This network is created through M5 (G@A) or AirMax (GP300)™Ubiquiti\nBullets, Rockets, and a parabolic communications antenna. For G@A these were provided by the\nPierre Auger Collaboration. Bi-directional transmission tests were performed point-to-point,i.e.,\nDU to DAQ, in both arrays, using a fixed file size. The uplink speed, from DU to DAQ, was on\naverage 2.9 MB s−1 for GP300 and 2.1 MB s−1 for G@A. The downlink speed, from DAQ to\nDU, was on average 4.2 MB s−1 for GP300 and 1.1 MB s−1 for G@A. The local and central DAQ\nsoftware pipeline is described in the next section.\nIn both arrays, the power supply of each DU consists of a solar panel, a charge controller, and\na battery. The power consumption of a single DU is roughly 15W. The power supply components\nwerespecifiedtoensuretheDUscanoperateforoneweekonafullbattery,evenwithoutinputfrom\nthesolarpanel. InGP300,thesolarpanelshaveanominalpowerof180W,withamaximumpower\nvoltageof19.5V.Low-noisechargecontrollers(GenasunGV-10-Pb-12V)werechosentoefficiently\ncharge the battery from the solar panel as well as provide power to the FEBs. Cold-resistant gel\nbatteries were selected, operating at a nominal output voltage of 12V with a capacity of 200Ah.\nIn G@A, the AERA electronics compartment and power harvesting were mostly re-used, as\nthe power requirements of the prototype GRAND FEB match the AERA electronics quite closely.\nThesolarpanelwasthesameoriginallydeployedintheAERA-IIstations(Kyocera135W),witha\nnominalpowerof135Wandmaximumoutputvoltageof16V.Newchargecontrollers,ofthesame\nmodelasdeployedatGP300,wereinstalledtoreplacetheoriginalAERAones. Thebatterieswere\nalso exchanged for lead-acid batteries with a nominal output voltage of 12V and 180Ah capacity.\nOverall, the final power supply for G@A has a smaller capacity than for GP300. As a result, G@A\nDUs may need to hibernate during Argentinian winters, depending on their battery levels.\nIn GP300 and G@A, the charge controllers are housed in Faraday cages. To further isolate\nthem from electromagnetic noise, a filter (Spectrum Control 1250-054) was added to the output\nof the charge controller. The Bullet is also housed in the FEB box at G@A, and, due to the\nheat-dissipation modifications, in a separate Faraday cage at GP300.\n4 Self-trigger and data acquisition\n4.1 Self-trigger algorithm\nThe main science case of GRAND—the study of ultra-high-energy particles [1]—involves the\ndetection of extensive air showers. The radio emission from air showers induces a temporary\n– 15 –Figure13.LocalTriggerflowforanincomingsignalataGRANDdetectionunit.Thetriggeralgorithm\nstarts when the amplitude of the signal exceeds the preset “signal threshold\",i.e., when a signal crossing\nhappens, as long as there was no such crossing in the preceding quiet time window. In the time period\nfollowing the signal crossing, called the “trigger period window”, the algorithm counts the number of\ncrossings of a lower “noise threshold\". If the number of noise-threshold crossings is between predefined\nallowed minimum and maximum values, and the time interval between any two adjacent noise-threshold\ncrossings does not exceed a predefined maximum value, the trigger process is completed and the signal is\naccepted. Because the trigger logic runs under the 500-MHz clock in the FPGA, the timing has a resolution\nof 2 ns. The time stamp, corresponding to the time of the end of the trigger period window, is recorded and\nit is sent to the Central DAQ.\ndistortion of the local electric field, with a duration of several nanoseconds. Through the data\nacquisition chain described above, this distortion is translated into a short transient in the voltage\ninputtotheADC.However,anthropogenicsourcesalsoemitradiopulseswithsimilarcharacteristics.\nThus, air-shower experiments that rely solely on their radio-detection, like the GRAND prototype\narrays, must have a self-triggering procedure that selects only detected events that resemble those\nexpected from air showers.\nThe detected radio pulse emitted by an air shower generates a short-duration, high-amplitude\n(relative to the average baseline) oscillation in the FEB output. Man-made noise usually creates\na wider pulse or a train of pulses. In addition, constructive interference of single-frequency\nanthropogenic sources can also create air shower-like pulses. The Local Trigger happens at the\nDU level and is implemented within the firmware running on the FPGA chip. Its aim is to select\nair-shower candidates while rejecting background pulses by efficiently identifying peaks in the\ndifferenceoftwoconsecutiveADCsamples. WiththeprototypeGRANDFEB,itispossibletofirst\nremove single-frequency noise sources with a digital filter, as shown in Section 3.3. The resulting\nfiltered signal is fed to the trigger algorithm.\nFigure 13 shows a representative flowchart of the trigger algorithm, which begins with a\nconfigurable “signal threshold”. If the signal exceeds this threshold and there has not been any\nthreshold crossing in a time window prior to the current pulse, the algorithm starts. The signal\n– 16 –threshold is set to a value that is suitably higher than the average noise level, while maintaining a\nreasonable trigger rate. The second of these conditions aims to avoid pulse trains. Next, in a time\nwindow after the pulse, the system counts how many times a second “noise threshold” is crossed.\nThe width of the time windows, the signal and noise threshold levels, the allowed maximum\nnumber of crossings of the noise threshold, and the maximum time between successive crossings\nare adjustable parameters. They are set offline at the Central DAQ prior to each data acquisition\nrun. The values are chosen to best reject long and/or irregular pulse trains, and to prevent digital\nglitchesfromcorruptingthevoltagetraces. Thistriggerflexibilityallowsustoadapttothedifferent\nnoise environments of each array, with G@A requiring stricter settings to avoid the more frequent\nnarrow and broadband radio frequency interference (RFI). When all triggering conditions are met,\nthe Local Trigger is complete and the timestamp is sent to the Central DAQ.\nNext to recording air showers, the arrays also keep track of the background conditions via\nunbiasedtriggering. This corresponds to periodically recorded data, independent of the measured\nvoltage levels. Such unbiased data are suitable for monitoring the environment and for calibrating\nthe setups using the periodic variation of the Galactic noise, which is currently ongoing [30, 36].\nUnbiased data can also be used for additional science cases like measuring fast radio bursts [48].\nUnbiased triggering, by default, takes place once every 10 s (a pre-defined 20-Hz mode is also\navailable). In the G@A firmware version, it is possible to set the unbiased triggering frequency\nbetween 1Hz and 100kHz. GP300 and G@A perform both transient and unbiased triggering.\nAchievingahighself-triggerperformanceiskeytothesuccessofastandaloneradio-detection\nexperimentsuchasGRAND.Theachievedtriggerrateasafunctionoftheincomingrateoftransient\npulses is of particular importance.

The Central Trigger conditions are checked at the\nCentral DAQ and, if met, the complete event information is requested of each Local DAQ. The full event\nis sent and erased from local memory and the Central DAQ writes the final data to disk. The cycle repeats\nindefinitely while the data-taking is ongoing. Unbiased triggered events bypass the Local Trigger at the\nFPGA but still go through the same DAQ pipeline. See Section 4 for details.\nanditsevent-buildingprocess. Thisprocesscombinesallinformationintoasingleeventandwrites\nthe data to the local disk. All coincident transient triggered data that satisfy the Central Trigger are\nrecorded incoincident data(CD) binary files.\nFurthermore, a random selection of local transient triggered events can be promoted to a\nCentral Trigger and be saved as well. These events have no coincidences with other DUs and are\nusedtomonitorthetriggeralgorithmandthenoiseenvironment. Theyarestoredseparatelyinunit\ndata(UD) binary files. Unbiased triggers are always promoted to Central triggers and are saved in\nmonitoringdata (MD) files.\n5 Data storage\nThe final data files of each trigger type—CD, UD, and MD—are saved on the local storage of the\nCentral DAQ computer in GP300 and G@A. For GP300, the binary files are sent in real time to a\ncomputercenterinNanjing,China,throughawirelessbridge. Thefilesarethenmanuallymovedto\nthe CC-IN2P3 cluster in Lyon, France. For G@A, new files on disk are copied daily to the central\nstorage in CC-IN2P3 using the 4G network. This copying does not interfere with the data-taking\nor the bandwidth used by the Pierre Auger Collaboration. In case of high RFI conditions or failed\noff-site data transfer, the DAQ computer has enough memory to store all data.\nThe automatic copying requires a local bash script to run automatically (i.e., acronjob) on\nthe central computer for G@A and semi-manually for GP300. This script first searches for files\nnot already transferred to CC-IN2P3 and stores this list in a simple local SQLite database. This\n– 18 –database is used to keep track of previously transferred files and to determine if a file needs to be\nsent. Afterwards,thenewdatafilesarerelayedtothecorrespondingdirectoriesonCC-IN2P3using\nrsyncand then flagged into the local SQLite database.\nWhen data dispatch is finalized, a second script is triggered in CC-IN2P3 that registers all\nnewly transferred files in the main database and launches the conversion into the GRANDRoot\nformat, described in Ref. [48]. The GRANDRoot files are moved to the corresponding directories\nand registered in the main database.\n6 Data quality monitoring\nTo ensure adequate data quality during the deployment and commissioning phases of GP300 and\nG@A,afewkeyparametersaretrackedineveryDU.Aspreviouslystated,acompleteeventconsists\nofthetriggeredADCtimetracesandtheslowcontrolparameters,likethebatterylevelattheboard\ninput, the GPS, and, in G@A alone, the ADC and FPGA chip temperatures and the trigger rate.\nThrough the unbiased triggered data, these parameters can be continuously monitored. Their\nbehaviorwasusednotonlytocommissionthearraysbutalsotovalidatethefirmwareandthelocal\nand central DAQ software. Other features—such as their root mean square (RMS), fast Fourier\ntransform, and power spectral densities (PSDs)—are extracted from the ADC traces in the time\ndomain to monitor day-night effects and detect local radio transients. Particularly, the PSDs can\nbe used to characterize the environment radio background, the electronic noise self-induced by the\nsetup, the Galactic radio background, and the RFI. These parameters are checked daily to ensure\noptimal operation of the setups. We monitor their behavior over time, comparing them between\nDUs to achieve consistent data quality across the array.\nThe commissioning is facilitated by a data monitoring web page. The page is updated daily at\n05:00CET,byacrontabjobthatrunsaseriesofscriptsatCC-IN2P3onthedatafrombotharrays.\nThe DU uptime, the mean RMS of the last 24 hours of traces, battery levels, and temperatures\nare tracked as a function of time. Averaged PSDs are also displayed for easy comparison between\nchannels and between DUs. The page also stores the averages over the last 7 days and the last 30\ndays. There is flexibility to present the data of all DUs together or of only the desired ones.\n7 First results\nGP300andG@Ahaveoperatedforabouttwoyearssincetheendoftheirdeployment(withGP300\nchanging from comprising 13 to 65 DUs). Throughout this period, enough unbiased triggered data\nwascollectedtocharacterizetheperformanceoftheDUsandthelocalelectromagneticenvironment.\nThese studies were performed in the frequency domain, where the complete antenna readout chain\nisbetterunderstoodandbackgroundsourcescanbeidentified. Inaddition,astheDUsaredeployed\nrelatively close together, working in the frequency domain allowed us to verify that all of them\nshowed similar response, which is needed to understand the relative calibration between DUs.\nFigure 15 shows spectrograms generated using data collected by two DUs, one from GP300\nandonefromG@A,overaperiodofaboutnineandthirteendays,respectively. Thesespectrograms\nare representative of the standard behavior of all DUs in their respective arrays.\n– 19 –Power spectrum density [mV² MHz⁻¹]\n10⁻⁴ 10⁻³ 10⁻² 10⁻¹ 10⁰ 10¹ 10² 10³\nGRAND@AugerGRANDProto300\nNorth-South\nEast-West\nVertical\nNorth-South\nEast-West\nVertical\nFigure 15.Spectrograms measured by GRAND detection units.Each row shows spectrograms for a dif-\nferent antenna polarization: North-South (top), East-West (center), and vertical (bottom).

Of the intermittent contributions,\none at around 70 MHz can be seen in all polarizations, where there is an increase of amplitude for\na few hours with no clear periodicity. In the North-South polarization, the four lines within 60–80\nMHz correspond to the known emission of the AERA beacon, set up at the CRS (see Fig. 2).\nIn Fig. 15, the white horizontal lines represent periods of DU hibernation, after which data\nacquisition resumes autonomously once the conditions are appropriate. The G@A DU had more\nhibernation periods than the GP300 DU, a reflection of the harsher environment in Argentina,\nleading to more periods with insufficient sunlight to power the batteries and more instances of\noverheating. In general, the radio environment at GP300 is considerably quieter than at G@A,\nbut wide background-free frequency bands exist at both sites. Nevertheless, the background in\nseveral frequency ranges is substantial and can negatively influence the self-trigger capabilities of\nthe system, especially in G@A.\nFigure 16 shows the time-averaged PSDs of GP300 and G@A, where the background noise\n– 21 –contributions can be more clearly seen. For GP300, the PSD is mostly free of peaks, except in the\n118–140MHzrange—inagreementwithFig.15—wheretherearestrongcontributionsfromplane\nandsatellitecommunications.

In particular, the G@A PSD characterizes the electromagnetic background at the Pierre\nAuger site at frequencies much higher than either AERA or the Auger Radio Detector are capable\nof measuring. This can aid and complement analyses of the Pierre Auger Collaboration—another\nexample of the synergy between the Pierre Auger Observatory and GRAND.\nFigures 15 and 16 show that, while radio background is unavoidable in both arrays, it is\nlocalized within frequency ranges that can be isolated and masked out in specific analyses. For\ninstance,searchesforthediffuseGalacticradioemissionrequirenoise-freefrequencyranges,dueto\ntheloweremissionamplitudeofthisbackgroundcomparedtoartificialradiosources. Thissearchis\nongoing in both prototype arrays [29, 30], since it presents an opportunity for detector calibration.\nThe above results show that the radio background at both sites is understood. At the GP300\nsite, there are fewer RFI sources compared to the G@A site. The baseline levels of the PSDs are\nthe same for both prototype arrays, around10−2 mV2 MHz−1. In summary, early data from the\nGRAND prototype arrays already validate their usefulness: that,despite differences in hardware\nand software, the overall response of the GRAND DU is consistent regardless of the deployment\nsite.This is a structural finding for future cross-calibration runs and for the later stages of the\nexperiment, which envision two or more 10,000-DU arrays deployed at different geographical\nlocations, and whose data will be analyzed jointly.\n8 Summary and perspectives\nThe Giant Radio Array for Neutrino Detection (GRAND) is a planned observatory of ultra-high-\nenergy particles of cosmic origin: cosmic rays, neutrinos, and gamma rays. GRAND aims to\ndetect the radio emission from air showers initiated by their interaction in the atmosphere using\nlarge ground arrays of antennas. The next large deployment goal of GRAND is to have two arrays\nconsistingof10,000antennaseachintheNorthernandSouthernHemispheres. Toachievethis,the\nGRANDCollaborationhasadoptedastagedapproachtodeployment,withthreeongoingprototype\narrays to test and validate the detection and reconstruction methods.\nThree prototype arrays were deployed in 2023. GRAND@Nançay, in France, is a 4-antenna\narrayusedasatestbenchfortheCollaboration’sEuropeanlaboratories. GRANDProto300,inChina,\nhasgonethroughtwostagesofdeployment,fromaninitial13-antennastagetoitscurrent65-antenna\nstage. These stages act as pathfinders for the future final 300-antenna array. GRAND@Auger, in\nArgentina, stems from an agreement between the GRAND and the Pierre Auger Collaborations.\nThe 10-antenna array was deployed on modified AERA stations. In this paper, we focused on the\nhardware, software, and early operation of GRANDProto300 and GRAND@Auger.\nTo adapt to local conditions and explore optimal designs for the final GRAND setup, the\nprototype array at each site featured different key choices in hardware and software. Throughout\n2023, the arrays, including their hardware, firmware, and DAQ software, were commissioned\nusing daily data monitoring. Operating these prototypes under prolonged field conditions exposed\nhardware and software challenges that have been met.\n– 23 –GRANDProto300andGRAND@Augerhaveremainedlargelyoperationalforabouttwoyears.\nTheir data have been analyzed and understood. We have shown results based on these data that\ndemonstrate the adequacy of the GRAND experimental setup and provide an understanding of the\nradiobackgroundpresentateachsite. ThedetectionoftheGalacticradioemission—thesearchfor\nwhich is ongoing in both prototypes—will refine the calibration of the GRAND detection units.\nTheGRANDprototypeshavealreadyyieldedakeyresult: thattheperformanceoftheGRAND\ndetection units is similar at the two array sites, despite one having a radio background notably\nhigher than the other, and despite their differences in hardware and software. The demonstrated\nresilience of the GRAND DU is not merely a technical achievement; it is a foundational scientific\nresult for the entire project. A future stage of GRAND consisting of arrays distributed in multiple\ngeographicallocationswillinevitablyfacediverseenvironmentalandradio-backgroundconditions.\nOur finding that consistent performance can be achieved through adaptable hardware and software\nconfirms the feasibility of combining data from geographically distant arrays. This is essential for\nachieving the full-sky coverage and large-scale exposure of future stages of GRAND.\nThe ultimate goal of GRANDProto300 and GRAND@Auger is to validate the autonomous\nradio-detection of inclined extensive air showers in GRAND, expected from ultra-high-energy\ncosmic rays, neutrinos, and gamma rays. This detection, triggered by no signal other than radio,\nand with a high efficiency, is essential to the goals of GRAND. Presently, the data collected by\nGRANDProto300 and GRAND@Auger are being searched for air showers initiated by ultra-high-\nenergy cosmic rays. In GRANDProto300, we have identified the first cosmic-ray candidates [38–\n43]. In GRAND@Auger, the detection of cosmic-ray candidates is being validated through their\ncoincident detection by the Pierre Auger Observatory [47].\nAcknowledgments\nThe GRAND Collaboration acknowledges the significant contributions to this manuscript of Beat-\nriz de Errico, for her work on data management and analysis, site survey and construction, DAQ\nsoftwaredebugging,manuscriptwriting,andfigurepreparation;andofShenWang,forhisworkon\nGP300sitesurveyandconstruction,hardwareverification,andmanuscriptplanningandwriting.

This process, despite being highly suppressed\n(second order weak process,T 2ν\n1/2 ≈10 18 −10 21 yr), is allowed within the current formu-\nlation of the Standard Model (SM), as it entails lepton number conservation (∆L= 0),\nand has been experimentally observed for various even-even isotopes for which the single\nβdecay is energetically forbidden [1].\n(∗) E-mailgiovanna.saleh@phd.unipd.it\n1\narXiv:2509.21166v1  [nucl-ex]  25 Sep 20252G. SALEH ON BEHALF OF THE LEGEND COLLABORATION\nFig. 1b instead shows the Feynman diagram for the neutrinoless double beta decay\n(0νββ): in its final state only the two electrons appear, while the two neutrinos are\nmissing. This process, clearly entailing a lepton number violation of two units (∆L= 2),\nis not allowed within the current formulation of the SM, could take place only if neutrinos\nare Majorana fermions and has never been observed experimentally yet.\nn p\nn p\ne−\n¯νe\n¯νe\ne−\nW−\nW−\n2νββ\n(a)\nn p\nn p\ne−\ne−\n×\nW−\nW−\n¯νe\n¯νe\n0νββ\n(b)\nFig. 1.: Tree-level Feynman diagram of two neutrinos double beta decay (a) and neutri-\nnoless double beta decay in the hypothesis of light Majorana neutrino exchange (b)\nThe half life of 0νββdecay (T 0ν\n1/2) is related to the effective Majorana mass of the\nneutrinosm ββ = P\ni\n\f\fU2\neimi\n\f\f by Eq. (1), in whichG0ν(Qββ , Z) is the phase space integral,\nM0ν the nuclear matrix element andm e the mass of the electron.\n(1) [T 0ν\n1/2]−1 =G 0ν(Qββ , Z)|M0ν|2 |mββ |2\nm2e\nConsidering thatG 0ν(Qββ , Z) andM 0ν can be calculated, ifT 0ν\n1/2 is measured experi-\nmentally it would be possible to extractm ββ and therefore to obtain some information\nabout the value of the sum of the neutrino mass eigenvalues.\nBut how can we look for 0νββexperimentally and how do we distinguish it from the\n2νββ? The strategy is to measure the sum energy spectrum of the two emitted electrons.\nDue to the different kinematics of 2νββand 0νββ, the contributions to the spectrum\nof the two different decays are clearly separated. Assuming the nuclear recoil energy is\nnegligible, 2νββis a four body decay, therefore the sum of the energy of the two electrons\nhas a continuous distribution with values between 0 and the Q value of the decay (Qββ );\n0νββinstead is a two body decay, so the sum of the energy of the two electrons is exactly\nequal toQ ββ . The experimental signature of neutrinoless double beta decay is therefore\na sharp peak at the endpoint of theββspectrum, where the 2νββdistribution would\notherwise go to zero.\nMultipleββdecaying isotopes can be exploited for the search of neutrinoless dou-\nble beta decay, including 136Xe (EXO, KamLAND-Zen), 76Ge (GERDA, MAJORANA\nDemonstrator), 130Te (CUORE),100Mo (CUPID-Mo, NEMO-3), 82Se (CUPID-0, NEMO-\n3). The LEGEND experiment uses 76Ge, looking for the decay 76Ge→ 76Se + 2e− with\nQββ = 2039.061(7) keV [2].\n2. – LEGEND(-200)\nThe LEGEND project, building upon the expertise and results of the previous GERDA\nand MAJORANA Demonstrator experiments, aims at developing a two-phased exper-FIRST RESULTS FROM LEGEND-200 ON THE SEARCH FOR NEUTRINOLESS DOUBLE BETA DECAY3\nimental campaign. The first phase (current generation), LEGEND-200, foresees the\ninstallation of 200 kg of germanium; with a total exposure of 1 ton yr and a target back-\nground index (BI) of 2·10 −4 counts/(keV kg yr), it is planned to reach 3σdiscovery\nsensitivity for a 0νββhalf life of about 10 27 yr, corresponding tom ββ ≈33−89 meV.\nThe second phase (next generation), LEGEND-1000, foresees the installation of 1000 kg\nof germanium; with a total exposure of 10 ton yr and a target BI of 10 −5 counts/(keV\nkg yr), it is planned to reach 3σdiscovery sensitivity for a 0νββhalf life beyond 10 28 yr,\ncorresponding tom ββ ≈9−24 meV.\nFig. 2.: LEGEND-200 HPGe detector geometries\nAfter a commissioning period with 60 kg of Ge, LEGEND-200 started taking physics\ndata in March 2023 with a total Ge mass of 142.5 kg. LEGEND detectors are active\nHigh Purity Germanium (HPGe) detectors, enriched in 76Ge up to a fraction between\n86% and 92% (depending on the detector type) from a natural abundance of∼8% [3]:\ntheir intrinsic background level is extremely low and their energy resolution is excellent,\nreaching a FWHM(Qββ )∼0.1%. The employed germanium crystals have masses ranging\nbetween∼0.5-4 kg and are operated as fully depleted diodes by applying a suitable high\nvoltage: when an interaction takes place in the germanium, the released energy ionizes\nthe atoms and the produced charge cloud drifts towards the electrodes, where it can\nbe collected and amplified. The amplitude of such charge signal is proportional to the\nenergy released in the interaction, which is the observable needed for the 0νββsearch.\nFour types of germanium detectors are currently used in LEGEND-200 (Fig. 2): 6 Coax\nand 28 BEGe from GERDA, 26 PPC from MAJORANA Demonstrator, and 41 Inverted\nCoaxial Point Contact (IC) detectors newly produced for LEGEND.\nBEGe, PPC and IC geometries are particularly convenient for LEGEND because the\nresulting electric field inside the detector is such that the shape of the produced signals\nis correlated to the topology of the energy deposition in the germanium. In 0νββevents,\nthe two electrons interact within∼1 mm 3, creating a highly localized, single-site energy\ndeposition; this is not the case for many background events, particularly gamma interac-\ntions, which produce multi-site depositions. The combination of the detectors’ sensitivity\nto different topologies and the unique topology signature of 0νββevents enables therefore\naccurate background rejection using pulse shape discrimination (PSD) techniques.\nThe HPGe detectors array is the core of the LEGEND-200 experiment, represented\nin Fig. 3. These detectors are operated bare in a 64 m 3 Liquid Argon (LAr) cryostat\nat∼88 K. LAr serves not only as a coolant and as a passive shield, but also as an\nactive background veto, thanks to the instrumentation deployed in it: two barrels of\nwavelength-shifting (WLS) fibers are coupled at each end to silicon photomultipliers\n(SiPMs) to detect the scintillation light produced when an interaction takes place within\nthe argon volume, allowing Ge-LAr anti-coincidence analysis. The LAr cryostat is placed\nin a 590 m 3 tank filled with ultra-pure water and instrumented with photomultiplier\ntubes (PMTs), which serves both as a passive shield and as Cherenkov detector for the\nfew cosmic muons reaching the experiment despite its underground location: the 14004G. SALEH ON BEHALF OF THE LEGEND COLLABORATION\nm rock overburden above LNGS provides a shield of almost 3500 m water equivalent,\nwhich removes the hadronic component of cosmic ray showers and reduces the muon flux\nby almost six orders of magnitude with respect to the surface, to a rate of about 1.2\nmuons/(m2 h) [4].\nFig. 3.: The LEGEND-200 experiment. Its main components are highlighted: a) Ge\ndetectors array; b) WLS fibers barrel for LAr veto; c) LAr cryostat; d) Water tank; e)\nPMTs\n3. – First results from LEGEND-200\nIn approximately one year of data taking, LEGEND-200 collected∼61 kg yr of data\nusable for the 0νββanalysis. During this period, the performance of the experiment and\nthe stability of the array have been thoroughly investigated.\nFig. 4.: 228Th calibration spectrum\n Fig. 5.: Energy resolution atQ ββ\nPhysics runs were alternated to weekly calibrations performed with 13 228Th sources\nofO(1 kBq) activity each. Fig. 4 shows the calibration spectra acquired by each de-\ntector type. The FWHM of each peak is calculated to estimate each detector’s energy\nresolution, as a function of the energy. This distribution is then fitted to extrapolate the\ndetector’s energy resolution atQ ββ . Fig. 5 displays such energy resolutions as a functionFIRST RESULTS FROM LEGEND-200 ON THE SEARCH FOR NEUTRINOLESS DOUBLE BETA DECAY5\nof the detector mass, color-coded by detector type: for most of the detectors the result\nis compatible with the LEGEND goal of FWHM(Q ββ )≤2.5 keV. A clear exception is\nCOAX detectors, whose energy resolution was though known to be relatively poor from\nGERDA measurements [5]: this will not be an issue in LEGEND-1000, in which only\nICPC are planned to be deployed.\nThe acquired physics energy spectrum is displayed in Fig. 6: different colors show the\nresult of the application of the different analysis cuts. The spectrum displayed in white\ncontains all the events that pass the muon veto and the Ge detectors anti-coincidence\ncut - definedmultiplicity cut-, both having efficiencyϵ muon(Qββ ), ϵmult(Qββ )>99.9%.\nThis spectrum exhibits all the expected features; however, when compared to background\npredictions based on the available radioassay data, it indicates that the background level\nis higher than expected, also in the region aroundQ ββ . The background model fit of this\nspectrum suggests that this excess could be imputable to the 228Th chain: a thorough\nscreening and cleaning campaign has been conducted to identify and eliminate the source\nof this contamination; confirmation of the expected background reduction will come with\nthe analysis of the data acquired after the redeployment of the array in May 2025. The\nspectrum of the events passing the LAr veto is displayed in grey: this cut is particularly\neffective at suppressing Compton event, and its efficiency reachesϵ LAr(Qββ )∼93%.\nFinally the spectrum of the events passing also the PSD cut is displayed in red: here\nthe 2νββdistribution is clearly recognizable in the lower energy region, while only few\nresidual background events appear at higher energies. The efficiency of the PSD cut\nreachesϵ PSD (Qββ )∼76−85% depending on the detector type.\nFig. 6.: LEGEND-200 energy spectrum. The inset shows the unblinded analysis window.\nAll the data selection routines are optimized and applied in a strictly blind scheme\nin the regionQ ββ ±25 keV, displayed in light gray. The energy range considered for the\nstatistical analysis aimed at the calculation of the background index (BI) and of the half\nlife limit is [1930-2190] keV with the exclusion of two known gamma lines, [2104±5] keV\nfrom 208Tl and [2119±5] keV from 214Bi.\nTwo separate unblindings have been performed for two different subsets of the ac-\nquired data, which are expected to have different background levels. The so called6G. SALEH ON BEHALF OF THE LEGEND COLLABORATION\ngolden datasetconsists of 48.3 kg yr of exposure coming from BEGe, PPC and ICPC\nproduced by Mirion, while the so calledsilver datasetconsists of 12.7 kg yr of expo-\nsure coming from COAX and ICPC produced by ORTEC. A total of 11 events survive\nall the cuts in the analysis window (inset of Fig. 6), 7 from thegolden datasetand 4\nfrom thesilver dataset.\nThe frequentist analysis finds no evidence of a 0νββsignal and sets a lower limit on\nits half life toT 0ν\n1/2 >0.5·10 26 yr at 90% confidence level (CL), with a median exclusion\nsensitivity of 1.0·10 26 yr. The achieved background index results to be 0.5 +0.3\n−0.2 ·10 −3\ncounts/(keV kg yr) in thegolden datasetand 1.3 +0.8\n−0.5 ·10 −3 counts/(keV kg yr) in the\nsilver dataset. A combined GERDA (127.2 kg yr) + MAJORANA Demonstrator\n(64.5 kg yr) + LEGEND-200 (61 kg yr) fit is finally performed: also in this case no\nevidence of a 0νββsignal is found and a lower limit to its half life is set instead to\nT0ν\n1/2 >1.9·10 26 yr at 90% CL, with a median exclusion sensitivity of 2.8·10 26 yr.\nThe corresponding Bayesian analysis provides compatible results. Constraints on the\neffective Majorana mass are calculated in the frequentist framework using a range of\nnuclear matrix elements from phenomenological calculations: the obtained upper limits\nrange betweenm ββ <75–200 meV [6].\n4. – Conclusions\nThe LEGEND-200 experiment successfully completed the first year of physics data\ntaking collecting the first 61 kg yr of exposure. The background level appearing in those\ndata is slightly higher than expected from radioassays prediction: for this reason an\nextensive screening and cleaning campaign was undertaken, whose outcome is expected\nto be clear by the end of summer 2025. The background excess is anyway successfully\nmitigated by the implemented analysis cuts, in particular by the combination of LAr\nveto and PSD cut.

This process, despite being highly suppressed\n(second order weak process,T 2ν\n1/2 ≈10 18 −10 21 yr), is allowed within the current formu-\nlation of the Standard Model (SM), as it entails lepton number conservation (∆L= 0),\nand has been experimentally observed for various even-even isotopes for which the single\nβdecay is energetically forbidden [1].\n(∗) E-mailgiovanna.saleh@phd.unipd.it\n1\narXiv:2509.21166v1  [nucl-ex]  25 Sep 20252G. SALEH ON BEHALF OF THE LEGEND COLLABORATION\nFig. 1b instead shows the Feynman diagram for the neutrinoless double beta decay\n(0νββ): in its final state only the two electrons appear, while the two neutrinos are\nmissing. This process, clearly entailing a lepton number violation of two units (∆L= 2),\nis not allowed within the current formulation of the SM, could take place only if neutrinos\nare Majorana fermions and has never been observed experimentally yet.\nn p\nn p\ne−\n¯νe\n¯νe\ne−\nW−\nW−\n2νββ\n(a)\nn p\nn p\ne−\ne−\n×\nW−\nW−\n¯νe\n¯νe\n0νββ\n(b)\nFig. 1.: Tree-level Feynman diagram of two neutrinos double beta decay (a) and neutri-\nnoless double beta decay in the hypothesis of light Majorana neutrino exchange (b)\nThe half life of 0νββdecay (T 0ν\n1/2) is related to the effective Majorana mass of the\nneutrinosm ββ = P\ni\n\f\fU2\neimi\n\f\f by Eq.

The strategy is to measure the sum energy spectrum of the two emitted electrons.\nDue to the different kinematics of 2νββand 0νββ, the contributions to the spectrum\nof the two different decays are clearly separated. Assuming the nuclear recoil energy is\nnegligible, 2νββis a four body decay, therefore the sum of the energy of the two electrons\nhas a continuous distribution with values between 0 and the Q value of the decay (Qββ );\n0νββinstead is a two body decay, so the sum of the energy of the two electrons is exactly\nequal toQ ββ . The experimental signature of neutrinoless double beta decay is therefore\na sharp peak at the endpoint of theββspectrum, where the 2νββdistribution would\notherwise go to zero.\nMultipleββdecaying isotopes can be exploited for the search of neutrinoless dou-\nble beta decay, including 136Xe (EXO, KamLAND-Zen), 76Ge (GERDA, MAJORANA\nDemonstrator), 130Te (CUORE),100Mo (CUPID-Mo, NEMO-3), 82Se (CUPID-0, NEMO-\n3). The LEGEND experiment uses 76Ge, looking for the decay 76Ge→ 76Se + 2e− with\nQββ = 2039.061(7) keV [2].\n2. – LEGEND(-200)\nThe LEGEND project, building upon the expertise and results of the previous GERDA\nand MAJORANA Demonstrator experiments, aims at developing a two-phased exper-FIRST RESULTS FROM LEGEND-200 ON THE SEARCH FOR NEUTRINOLESS DOUBLE BETA DECAY3\nimental campaign. The first phase (current generation), LEGEND-200, foresees the\ninstallation of 200 kg of germanium; with a total exposure of 1 ton yr and a target back-\nground index (BI) of 2·10 −4 counts/(keV kg yr), it is planned to reach 3σdiscovery\nsensitivity for a 0νββhalf life of about 10 27 yr, corresponding tom ββ ≈33−89 meV.\nThe second phase (next generation), LEGEND-1000, foresees the installation of 1000 kg\nof germanium; with a total exposure of 10 ton yr and a target BI of 10 −5 counts/(keV\nkg yr), it is planned to reach 3σdiscovery sensitivity for a 0νββhalf life beyond 10 28 yr,\ncorresponding tom ββ ≈9−24 meV.\nFig. 2.: LEGEND-200 HPGe detector geometries\nAfter a commissioning period with 60 kg of Ge, LEGEND-200 started taking physics\ndata in March 2023 with a total Ge mass of 142.5 kg. LEGEND detectors are active\nHigh Purity Germanium (HPGe) detectors, enriched in 76Ge up to a fraction between\n86% and 92% (depending on the detector type) from a natural abundance of∼8% [3]:\ntheir intrinsic background level is extremely low and their energy resolution is excellent,\nreaching a FWHM(Qββ )∼0.1%. The employed germanium crystals have masses ranging\nbetween∼0.5-4 kg and are operated as fully depleted diodes by applying a suitable high\nvoltage: when an interaction takes place in the germanium, the released energy ionizes\nthe atoms and the produced charge cloud drifts towards the electrodes, where it can\nbe collected and amplified. The amplitude of such charge signal is proportional to the\nenergy released in the interaction, which is the observable needed for the 0νββsearch.\nFour types of germanium detectors are currently used in LEGEND-200 (Fig. 2): 6 Coax\nand 28 BEGe from GERDA, 26 PPC from MAJORANA Demonstrator, and 41 Inverted\nCoaxial Point Contact (IC) detectors newly produced for LEGEND.\nBEGe, PPC and IC geometries are particularly convenient for LEGEND because the\nresulting electric field inside the detector is such that the shape of the produced signals\nis correlated to the topology of the energy deposition in the germanium. In 0νββevents,\nthe two electrons interact within∼1 mm 3, creating a highly localized, single-site energy\ndeposition; this is not the case for many background events, particularly gamma interac-\ntions, which produce multi-site depositions. The combination of the detectors’ sensitivity\nto different topologies and the unique topology signature of 0νββevents enables therefore\naccurate background rejection using pulse shape discrimination (PSD) techniques.\nThe HPGe detectors array is the core of the LEGEND-200 experiment, represented\nin Fig. 3. These detectors are operated bare in a 64 m 3 Liquid Argon (LAr) cryostat\nat∼88 K. LAr serves not only as a coolant and as a passive shield, but also as an\nactive background veto, thanks to the instrumentation deployed in it: two barrels of\nwavelength-shifting (WLS) fibers are coupled at each end to silicon photomultipliers\n(SiPMs) to detect the scintillation light produced when an interaction takes place within\nthe argon volume, allowing Ge-LAr anti-coincidence analysis. The LAr cryostat is placed\nin a 590 m 3 tank filled with ultra-pure water and instrumented with photomultiplier\ntubes (PMTs), which serves both as a passive shield and as Cherenkov detector for the\nfew cosmic muons reaching the experiment despite its underground location: the 14004G. SALEH ON BEHALF OF THE LEGEND COLLABORATION\nm rock overburden above LNGS provides a shield of almost 3500 m water equivalent,\nwhich removes the hadronic component of cosmic ray showers and reduces the muon flux\nby almost six orders of magnitude with respect to the surface, to a rate of about 1.2\nmuons/(m2 h) [4].\nFig. 3.: The LEGEND-200 experiment. Its main components are highlighted: a) Ge\ndetectors array; b) WLS fibers barrel for LAr veto; c) LAr cryostat; d) Water tank; e)\nPMTs\n3. – First results from LEGEND-200\nIn approximately one year of data taking, LEGEND-200 collected∼61 kg yr of data\nusable for the 0νββanalysis. During this period, the performance of the experiment and\nthe stability of the array have been thoroughly investigated.\nFig. 4.: 228Th calibration spectrum\n Fig. 5.: Energy resolution atQ ββ\nPhysics runs were alternated to weekly calibrations performed with 13 228Th sources\nofO(1 kBq) activity each. Fig. 4 shows the calibration spectra acquired by each de-\ntector type. The FWHM of each peak is calculated to estimate each detector’s energy\nresolution, as a function of the energy. This distribution is then fitted to extrapolate the\ndetector’s energy resolution atQ ββ . Fig. 5 displays such energy resolutions as a functionFIRST RESULTS FROM LEGEND-200 ON THE SEARCH FOR NEUTRINOLESS DOUBLE BETA DECAY5\nof the detector mass, color-coded by detector type: for most of the detectors the result\nis compatible with the LEGEND goal of FWHM(Q ββ )≤2.5 keV. A clear exception is\nCOAX detectors, whose energy resolution was though known to be relatively poor from\nGERDA measurements [5]: this will not be an issue in LEGEND-1000, in which only\nICPC are planned to be deployed.\nThe acquired physics energy spectrum is displayed in Fig. 6: different colors show the\nresult of the application of the different analysis cuts. The spectrum displayed in white\ncontains all the events that pass the muon veto and the Ge detectors anti-coincidence\ncut - definedmultiplicity cut-, both having efficiencyϵ muon(Qββ ), ϵmult(Qββ )>99.9%.\nThis spectrum exhibits all the expected features; however, when compared to background\npredictions based on the available radioassay data, it indicates that the background level\nis higher than expected, also in the region aroundQ ββ . The background model fit of this\nspectrum suggests that this excess could be imputable to the 228Th chain: a thorough\nscreening and cleaning campaign has been conducted to identify and eliminate the source\nof this contamination; confirmation of the expected background reduction will come with\nthe analysis of the data acquired after the redeployment of the array in May 2025. The\nspectrum of the events passing the LAr veto is displayed in grey: this cut is particularly\neffective at suppressing Compton event, and its efficiency reachesϵ LAr(Qββ )∼93%.\nFinally the spectrum of the events passing also the PSD cut is displayed in red: here\nthe 2νββdistribution is clearly recognizable in the lower energy region, while only few\nresidual background events appear at higher energies. The efficiency of the PSD cut\nreachesϵ PSD (Qββ )∼76−85% depending on the detector type.\nFig. 6.: LEGEND-200 energy spectrum. The inset shows the unblinded analysis window.\nAll the data selection routines are optimized and applied in a strictly blind scheme\nin the regionQ ββ ±25 keV, displayed in light gray. The energy range considered for the\nstatistical analysis aimed at the calculation of the background index (BI) and of the half\nlife limit is [1930-2190] keV with the exclusion of two known gamma lines, [2104±5] keV\nfrom 208Tl and [2119±5] keV from 214Bi.\nTwo separate unblindings have been performed for two different subsets of the ac-\nquired data, which are expected to have different background levels. The so called6G.

A total of 11 events survive\nall the cuts in the analysis window (inset of Fig. 6), 7 from thegolden datasetand 4\nfrom thesilver dataset.\nThe frequentist analysis finds no evidence of a 0νββsignal and sets a lower limit on\nits half life toT 0ν\n1/2 >0.5·10 26 yr at 90% confidence level (CL), with a median exclusion\nsensitivity of 1.0·10 26 yr.

A combined GERDA (127.2 kg yr) + MAJORANA Demonstrator\n(64.5 kg yr) + LEGEND-200 (61 kg yr) fit is finally performed: also in this case no\nevidence of a 0νββsignal is found and a lower limit to its half life is set instead to\nT0ν\n1/2 >1.9·10 26 yr at 90% CL, with a median exclusion sensitivity of 2.8·10 26 yr.\nThe corresponding Bayesian analysis provides compatible results. Constraints on the\neffective Majorana mass are calculated in the frequentist framework using a range of\nnuclear matrix elements from phenomenological calculations: the obtained upper limits\nrange betweenm ββ <75–200 meV [6].\n4. – Conclusions\nThe LEGEND-200 experiment successfully completed the first year of physics data\ntaking collecting the first 61 kg yr of exposure. The background level appearing in those\ndata is slightly higher than expected from radioassays prediction: for this reason an\nextensive screening and cleaning campaign was undertaken, whose outcome is expected\nto be clear by the end of summer 2025. The background excess is anyway successfully\nmitigated by the implemented analysis cuts, in particular by the combination of LAr\nveto and PSD cut. The frequentist analysis of the acquired data finds no evidence of\n0νββsignal and sets a limit ofT 0ν\n1/2 >0.5·10 26 yr at 90% CL with a BI of 0.5 +0.3\n−0.2 ·10 −3\ncounts/(keV kg yr) in thegolden datasetand 1.3 +0.8\n−0.5 ·10 −3 counts/(keV kg yr) in the\nsilver dataset. The combined GERDA, MAJORANA Demonstrator and LEGEND\nfit sets the 76Ge 0νββhalf life limit toT 0ν\n1/2 >1.9·10 26 yr at 90% CL.\nAcknowledgementsThis work is supported by the U.S. DOE, and the NSF, the LANL,\nORNL and LBNL LDRD programs; the European ERC and Horizon programs; the\nGerman DFG, BMBF, and MPG; the Italian INFN; the Polish NCN and MNiSW; the\nCzech MEYS; the Slovak RDA; the Swiss SNF; the UK STFC; the Canadian NSERC\nand CFI; the LNGS and SURF facilities.\nREFERENCES\n[1]Saakyan R.,Ann.

Moreover, laser-induced graphitisation\nenables embedding conductive regions within the diamond bulk, allowing flexible electrode\ngeometries[9–12]. In fig. 1a we report the schematic representation of the geometry of 3D\ndiamond sensors, in which the graphite electrodes are orthogonal to the diamond surface. In\nfig. 1b, we present an actual picture of such diamond detector.\nSimulating these devices is challenging: charge transport in the semiconductor and signal\npropagation through resistive electrodes contribute comparably to time resolution. A time-\ndependent extension of the Ramo-Shockley theorem captures these effects via dynamic weight-\ning potentials, governed by Maxwell equations in quasi-static approximation[13–15].\nBy using the extended form of the Ramo-Shockley theorem for conductive media, the con-\ntribution of the resistive material to the signal formation is included in the time evolution\nof the weighting potential, which is the solution of the Maxwell equations in the quasi-static\nlimit[16]:\nε∇2V(t,x) =−ρ(t,x)(1)\n∂t ρ(t,x) =∇·[σ(x)∇V(t,x)], (2)\nwhereV(t,x)is the weighting potential field,ε=ε 0εr is the dielectric constant in the mate-\nrial, which is the same for diamond and graphite, and thus constant on the whole geometry ,\nρ(t,x)is the charge distribution field, andσ(x)is the function defining the conductivity in\nthe diamond/graphite geometry . These equations can be condensed in a single, third-order\npartial differential equation\nε∂t ∇2V(t,x) +∇·[σ(x)∇V(t,x)] =0 .

The last condition applies to all the boundary region of\nΩwhere there is no intersection with conductive columns.\nNotice that this equation accounts for the timely response of the detector, with respect to\nits design: the manufacturable aspect of the geometry is kept into account in the function\nσ(x), which is the result of the manufacturing process.\n2SciPost Physics Proceedings Submission\n(a) Diagrammatic illustration of a three-\ndimensional diamond sensor, depicting a seg-\nment comprising four by four fundamental\nunits.

From\n[16]\nThe computation needed to solve the differential equation describing the system to obtain\nthe time-dependent electric field, via the (reformulated) Ramo-Shockley theorem, are highly\nnon-trivial.

Specifically , we employed a Mixture-of-Experts\nPINN (MoE-PINN) to perform mesh-free interpolation of Maxwell’s equations, under quasi-\nstatic approximation, both spatially and temporally , capturing the detector’s response to charged\nparticle passage via an extended Ramo-Shockley theorem for resistive media.\nDespite the complexity of the governing third-order PDE, characterised by a third-order\nPDE with an underlying approximate spatial functional symmetry3 V(t,x)7→V(t,x) +f(x)if\n∇2 f(x) =0, we successfully trained the MoE-PINN as a physics-informed, mesh-free surrogate\nfor the numerical solver. The model achieved a median error of approximately 3%, with the\nmost frequent error mode being lower at almost each timesteps.\n3Which is valid everywhere except where∇σ·∇V̸=0, i.e., only on the conductive cylinders surface.\n6SciPost Physics Proceedings Submission\nAcknowledgements\nFunding informationThis work is partly supported by ICSC – Centro Nazionale di Ricerca in\nHigh Performance Computing, Big Data and Quantum Computing, funded by European Union\n– NextGenerationEU.\nThe work of AB and AR was funded by Progetto ICSC - Spoke 2 - Codice CN00000013 - CUP\nI53C21000340006 - Missione 4 Istruzione e ricerca - Componente 2 Dalla ricerca all’impresa\n– Investimento 1.4.\nReferences\n[1]C.

Moreover, laser-induced graphitisation\nenables embedding conductive regions within the diamond bulk, allowing flexible electrode\ngeometries[9–12]. In fig. 1a we report the schematic representation of the geometry of 3D\ndiamond sensors, in which the graphite electrodes are orthogonal to the diamond surface. In\nfig. 1b, we present an actual picture of such diamond detector.\nSimulating these devices is challenging: charge transport in the semiconductor and signal\npropagation through resistive electrodes contribute comparably to time resolution. A time-\ndependent extension of the Ramo-Shockley theorem captures these effects via dynamic weight-\ning potentials, governed by Maxwell equations in quasi-static approximation[13–15].\nBy using the extended form of the Ramo-Shockley theorem for conductive media, the con-\ntribution of the resistive material to the signal formation is included in the time evolution\nof the weighting potential, which is the solution of the Maxwell equations in the quasi-static\nlimit[16]:\nε∇2V(t,x) =−ρ(t,x)(1)\n∂t ρ(t,x) =∇·[σ(x)∇V(t,x)], (2)\nwhereV(t,x)is the weighting potential field,ε=ε 0εr is the dielectric constant in the mate-\nrial, which is the same for diamond and graphite, and thus constant on the whole geometry ,\nρ(t,x)is the charge distribution field, andσ(x)is the function defining the conductivity in\nthe diamond/graphite geometry . These equations can be condensed in a single, third-order\npartial differential equation\nε∂t ∇2V(t,x) +∇·[σ(x)∇V(t,x)] =0 . (3)\nThe full system to describe the behaviour of the weighting field in the geometry is equipped\nwith an initial condition (IC)\nV(t=0,x) =\n¨\n+V0 ,x∈∂C + ∩∂Ω,\n0 , otherwise , (4)\nand boundary conditions (BC)\nV(t,x) = +V0 ,x∈∂C + ∩∂Ω, (5)\nV(t,x) =0 ,x∈∂C −∩∂Ω, (6)\nˆn·∇V(t,x) =0 ,x∈∂Ω\\\n[\ni\nCi , (7)\nwhereΩis the whole diamond+graphite geometry ,C ±are the conductive cylinders attached\nto potential (C+) or grounded (C−). The last condition applies to all the boundary region of\nΩwhere there is no intersection with conductive columns.\nNotice that this equation accounts for the timely response of the detector, with respect to\nits design: the manufacturable aspect of the geometry is kept into account in the function\nσ(x), which is the result of the manufacturing process.\n2SciPost Physics Proceedings Submission\n(a) Diagrammatic illustration of a three-\ndimensional diamond sensor, depicting a seg-\nment comprising four by four fundamental\nunits.

Specifically , we employed a Mixture-of-Experts\nPINN (MoE-PINN) to perform mesh-free interpolation of Maxwell’s equations, under quasi-\nstatic approximation, both spatially and temporally , capturing the detector’s response to charged\nparticle passage via an extended Ramo-Shockley theorem for resistive media.\nDespite the complexity of the governing third-order PDE, characterised by a third-order\nPDE with an underlying approximate spatial functional symmetry3 V(t,x)7→V(t,x) +f(x)if\n∇2 f(x) =0, we successfully trained the MoE-PINN as a physics-informed, mesh-free surrogate\nfor the numerical solver. The model achieved a median error of approximately 3%, with the\nmost frequent error mode being lower at almost each timesteps.\n3Which is valid everywhere except where∇σ·∇V̸=0, i.e., only on the conductive cylinders surface.\n6SciPost Physics Proceedings Submission\nAcknowledgements\nFunding informationThis work is partly supported by ICSC – Centro Nazionale di Ricerca in\nHigh Performance Computing, Big Data and Quantum Computing, funded by European Union\n– NextGenerationEU.\nThe work of AB and AR was funded by Progetto ICSC - Spoke 2 - Codice CN00000013 - CUP\nI53C21000340006 - Missione 4 Istruzione e ricerca - Componente 2 Dalla ricerca all’impresa\n– Investimento 1.4.\nReferences\n[1]C.

These LLPs, when produced in collisions at the Large Hadron\nCollider (LHC) at CERN, can be observed with the CMS detector[1]through their decays to\nSM particles at macroscopic distances from the interaction point (IP). The resulting signature\nis often different from that of promptly decaying particles, and requires dedicated triggering\ntechniques and algorithms. In this paper we describe the design, deployment, and perfor-\nmance of a fast neural network (NN) based algorithm implemented in the CMS Level-1 Trig-\nger (L1T)[2, 3]Endcap Muon Track Finder (EMTF), performing transverse momentum (p T )\nregression targeting muons originating from decays of LLPs.\nanow at Boston University\n1\narXiv:2509.21062v1  [hep-ex]  25 Sep 2025SciPost Physics Proceedings Submission\nThe CMS L1T is the first level of the two-level CMS trigger system, which is designed to\nselect interesting physics processes out of 40 MHz of LHC collisions. The L1T is implemented\non custom designed electronics, and it selects interesting collision events with a latency of\nabout 4µs using the reduced readout from the detectors. The EMTF is one of the three muon\ntrack finders in the CMS L1T that builds muon tracks and measures their kinematic properties\nand electric charge within a∼500 ns total latency budget. The CMS endcaps are a particularly\nchallenging environment for triggering due to factors such as non-uniform magnetic field in\nthe endcaps, the different detector technologies with different spatial and timing resolutions,\nand large collision backgrounds that increase with increasingηand can lead to a non-linear\ndependence of trigger rate with respect to number of simultaneous interactions in a collision\nevent. These challenges create an ideal problem for ML based solutions, which have been\nused in the EMTF system since Run 2 of the LHC in the form of a Boosted Decision Tree (BDT)\nbasedp T assignment algorithm that was optimized for prompt muons. In Run 3 of the LHC,\nwe introduced a new NN-based algorithm to measure thepT and transverse impact parameter\n(d0) of muon tracks originating from displaced vertices.\nThe following sections will describe the design, hardware implementation, deployment for\noperations, and the expected performance of the EMTF displaced NN algorithm.\n2 Design and Hardware Implementation\nAlthough the BDT-basedp T assignment algorithm is very capable for measuring thep T of\nprompt muons, its accuracy falls sharply with increasing muond0 after∼20 cm. This result is\ndue to the training samples used for the BDT , which contain only prompt muons, and the BDT\nlearning to extrapolate the muon track to the IP while estimating the muonp T essentially . In\norder to increase the trigger acceptance to highly displaced muons, a new ML algorithm that\nis trained with samples containing displaced muons is required. Additionally it is preferred\nto have an algorithm that does not modify the BDT-based method so as not to interfere with\nthe prompt muon triggering. Since there is also no spare latency in the EMTF budget, the\nresulting decision is to implement an ML-based algorithm that runs parallel to the BDT-based\npT assignment within the∼100 ns latency used by the BDT stage.\nThe Run 3 EMTF algorithm is implemented in Virtex 7 Field Programmable Gate Arrays\n(FPGAs). The resource usage of the EMTF FPGA before Run 3 was as follows:\n• 74% of FPGA Look-Up Tables (LUTs)\n• 2% of Digital Signal Processors (DSPs)\n• 76% Block RAMs (BRAMs)\n• 25% Flip Flops\nThis implies that while implementing the new ML algorithm there is virtually no con-\nstraint for using DSP resources, while the LUT and BRAM resources are already significantly\nconstrained. This makes an NN-based solution ideal for Run 3 EMTF since NNs can be imple-\nmented in FPGAs by using mostly DSP resources.\nTherefore an NN-based solution is chosen to be implemented in Run 3 EMTF system that\ntargets measurement ofp T andd 0 of displaced muons. Two separate NNs are developed in\nsoftware to targetp T andd 0 separately . Each of the NN models have three dense layers, and\nequally split half of the total nodes of the complete model. The two models are then stitched\ntogether to form a single NN model before being implemented into the FPGA. The models\nare trained on simulations of LLPs that decay to muons made with standard CMS software\nemulators.\n2SciPost Physics Proceedings Submission\nFigure 1: The overall design of the complete displaced NN model. The NN takes\n29 input features from each muon track and outputs the measuredp T andd 0 val-\nues. The complete model is obtained by stitching together two identical models with\nthree dense layers and total of 19 nodes with one model targetingp T and the other\ntargetingd 0.\nAfter the training, the complete model is quantized to fixed point precision and imple-\nmented into FPGAs using hls4ml[4]. In order to fit the NN model within the latency con-\nstraints, a wrapper around the NN model with fixed latency that also handles input/output\nconversions was implemented for the final design. The quantization of the bit-widths for\nweights and activations are chosen for optimal performance, since the DSP resource savings\nresulting from reducing the bit-widths further was irrelevant due to the available resources in\nthe FPGAs. Accumulation bit-widths were optimized to reduce the LUT usage without impact-\ning the performance significantly .\nFigure 2: The validation plots comparing measured and truepT (left) andd 0 (right).\nFinal implementation of the NN model fits into a latency of 83 ns. After the NN implemen-\ntation the LUT usage in the FPGA is 76% (from 74%) and the DSP usage is 14% (from 2%).\nThe validation of the model shows good agreement betweenp T andd 0 measured by the NN\nmodel and the true values. The underestimation ofp T at higher truep T is not crucial since\nthe current displaced muon trigger designs target 5-10 GeV range which has good accuracy .\n3SciPost Physics Proceedings Submission\n3 Deployment for Operations and Expected Performance\nThe displaced NN was deployed for CMS operations on 26th June 2023, making it the first\nNN running online in CMS L1T FPGAs during data taking. The commissioning of the NN was\nperformed during the 2023 data taking year using monitoring triggers such as the one seen\nin Fig. 3, and the first set of triggers making use of the NN basedp T andd 0 assignment were\ndeployed for data taking in 2024. Fig. 3 also shows the expected performance of the displaced\nNN and prompt BDT algorithms on a simulated sample of displaced muons produced with an\nearlier design of the NN model from 2022[5] b.\nFigure 3: The rate vs pile-up (PU) plot for one of the monitoring triggers designed\nto commission the displaced NN recorded in LHC proton-proton collisions from July\n2023 (left). The trigger requires one muon in EMTF acceptance withp T assigned\nby the displaced NN greater than 10 GeV and no requirement on thep T assigned by\nthe prompt BDT algorithm. The EMTF trigger efficiencies for prompt and displaced-\nmuon algorithms for L1p T >10 GeV with respect to muon trackd xy obtained using\na displaced-muon simulation sample (right). The solid stars show displaced NN per-\nformance while hollow squares show the prompt BDT performance. The different\ncolors show differentηregions: 1.2<|η|<1.6 (black), 1.6<|η|<2.1 (red), and\n2.1<|η|<2.5 (blue)[5].\n4 Conclusion\nThe CMS experiment aims to broaden the accessible phase space for searches that look for\nevidence of LLPs in the Run 3 of the LHC. A new fast NN-based algorithm to improve the\nefficiency of triggering on muons produced in the decays of LLPs was developed for the EMTF\nsystem, which was deployed for data-taking in 2023. The new NN-based algorithm offers\nsignificant improvements to triggering efficiency of muons withd 0 >20 cm compared to the\nprompt BDT-based method. The new triggers based on this algorithm will increase the physics\nreach of the CMS experiment for the remainder of the Run 3 of the LHC.\nbA more recent version of this plot was published in CMS-PAS-EXO-23-016\n4SciPost Physics Proceedings Submission\n5 Acknowledgments\nThis paper is based upon work supported in part by the U.S. Department of Energy , DOE\nGrants: DE-SC0023351 and DE-SC0010103\nReferences\n[1]CMS Collaboration,The CMS experiment at the CERN LHC, JINST3, S08004 (2008),\ndoi:10.1088/1748-0221/3/08/S08004.\n[2]CMS Collaboration,The CMS trigger system, JINST12(01), P01020 (2017),\ndoi:10.1088/1748-0221/12/01/P01020, 1609.02366.\n[3]CMS Collaboration,Performance of the CMS Level-1 trigger in proton-proton colli-\nsions at ps=13TeV, Journal of Instrumentation15(10), P10017–P10017 (2020),\ndoi:10.1088/1748-0221/15/10/p10017.\n[4]J.

The two models are then stitched\ntogether to form a single NN model before being implemented into the FPGA. The models\nare trained on simulations of LLPs that decay to muons made with standard CMS software\nemulators.\n2SciPost Physics Proceedings Submission\nFigure 1: The overall design of the complete displaced NN model. The NN takes\n29 input features from each muon track and outputs the measuredp T andd 0 val-\nues. The complete model is obtained by stitching together two identical models with\nthree dense layers and total of 19 nodes with one model targetingp T and the other\ntargetingd 0.\nAfter the training, the complete model is quantized to fixed point precision and imple-\nmented into FPGAs using hls4ml[4]. In order to fit the NN model within the latency con-\nstraints, a wrapper around the NN model with fixed latency that also handles input/output\nconversions was implemented for the final design. The quantization of the bit-widths for\nweights and activations are chosen for optimal performance, since the DSP resource savings\nresulting from reducing the bit-widths further was irrelevant due to the available resources in\nthe FPGAs. Accumulation bit-widths were optimized to reduce the LUT usage without impact-\ning the performance significantly .\nFigure 2: The validation plots comparing measured and truepT (left) andd 0 (right).\nFinal implementation of the NN model fits into a latency of 83 ns. After the NN implemen-\ntation the LUT usage in the FPGA is 76% (from 74%) and the DSP usage is 14% (from 2%).\nThe validation of the model shows good agreement betweenp T andd 0 measured by the NN\nmodel and the true values. The underestimation ofp T at higher truep T is not crucial since\nthe current displaced muon trigger designs target 5-10 GeV range which has good accuracy .\n3SciPost Physics Proceedings Submission\n3 Deployment for Operations and Expected Performance\nThe displaced NN was deployed for CMS operations on 26th June 2023, making it the first\nNN running online in CMS L1T FPGAs during data taking. The commissioning of the NN was\nperformed during the 2023 data taking year using monitoring triggers such as the one seen\nin Fig. 3, and the first set of triggers making use of the NN basedp T andd 0 assignment were\ndeployed for data taking in 2024. Fig. 3 also shows the expected performance of the displaced\nNN and prompt BDT algorithms on a simulated sample of displaced muons produced with an\nearlier design of the NN model from 2022[5] b.\nFigure 3: The rate vs pile-up (PU) plot for one of the monitoring triggers designed\nto commission the displaced NN recorded in LHC proton-proton collisions from July\n2023 (left). The trigger requires one muon in EMTF acceptance withp T assigned\nby the displaced NN greater than 10 GeV and no requirement on thep T assigned by\nthe prompt BDT algorithm.

The solid stars show displaced NN per-\nformance while hollow squares show the prompt BDT performance. The different\ncolors show differentηregions: 1.2<|η|<1.6 (black), 1.6<|η|<2.1 (red), and\n2.1<|η|<2.5 (blue)[5].\n4 Conclusion\nThe CMS experiment aims to broaden the accessible phase space for searches that look for\nevidence of LLPs in the Run 3 of the LHC. A new fast NN-based algorithm to improve the\nefficiency of triggering on muons produced in the decays of LLPs was developed for the EMTF\nsystem, which was deployed for data-taking in 2023. The new NN-based algorithm offers\nsignificant improvements to triggering efficiency of muons withd 0 >20 cm compared to the\nprompt BDT-based method. The new triggers based on this algorithm will increase the physics\nreach of the CMS experiment for the remainder of the Run 3 of the LHC.\nbA more recent version of this plot was published in CMS-PAS-EXO-23-016\n4SciPost Physics Proceedings Submission\n5 Acknowledgments\nThis paper is based upon work supported in part by the U.S. Department of Energy , DOE\nGrants: DE-SC0023351 and DE-SC0010103\nReferences\n[1]CMS Collaboration,The CMS experiment at the CERN LHC, JINST3, S08004 (2008),\ndoi:10.1088/1748-0221/3/08/S08004.\n[2]CMS Collaboration,The CMS trigger system, JINST12(01), P01020 (2017),\ndoi:10.1088/1748-0221/12/01/P01020, 1609.02366.\n[3]CMS Collaboration,Performance of the CMS Level-1 trigger in proton-proton colli-\nsions at ps=13TeV, Journal of Instrumentation15(10), P10017–P10017 (2020),\ndoi:10.1088/1748-0221/15/10/p10017.\n[4]J.

INTRODUCTION\nThe discovery of theX(3872) resonance at theD 0 ¯D∗0 threshold by the Belle II Col-\nlaboration in 2003 [1] inaugurated a new era in hadron spectroscopy, prompting extensive\nexperimental and theoretical efforts that have uncovered a growing number of candidate\nexotic states. Systematic identification and characterization of these states are essential\nbecause they furnish stringent tests of quantum chromodynamics (QCD) in the nonpertur-\nbative regime and illuminate the mechanisms of color confinement and multiquark dynamics.\nTherefore, continued discovery and detailed study of exotic hadronic states remain central\ngoals for both experiment and theory.\nOver the past two decades, numerous tetraquark and pentaquark candidates have been\nfirmly established [2–5]. Against this backdrop, conducting the exploration for hexaquark\nsystem is a natural and necessary extension of hadron spectroscopy. The investigation\nof hexaquark states has a long-standing history. As early as the 1940s, proposals were\nadvanced to interpret the pion as composite systems formed from nucleon-antinucleon pairs,\nreflecting early interest in multiquark configurations. More recently, the observations of a\nseries of states near thep¯pthreshold, such asX(1860) [6],X(1835) [7],X(1840) [8], and\nX(1880) [9], have rekindled and intensified efforts to search for and characterize hexaquark\ncandidates [10–25]. Current theoretical investigations for hexaquark states have mainly\nfocused on its molecular configuration, while studies for compact hexaquark states remain\ncomparatively scarce. However, to gain a complete understanding of exotic hadron states, it\nis essential to explore compact multiquark configurations that complement molecular states\nand may even be more fundamental.\nThe arrangements of a hexaquark system can include dibaryon (bound states of two\nbaryons), baryonium (bound states of baryon–antibaryon), and bound states formed by three\nmesons. Among the baryoniums, a special topology is that the baryon and the antibaryon are\nnot particle-antiparticle conjugates, such as the proton-antihyperon (p-¯Λ) bound state, which\nlead to the existence of a broader range of exotic states. Experimental evidence for this novel\narrangement includes the resonancesX(2075) andX(2085), which are both observed in the\np¯Λ final state [26, 27]. The mass spectra of thep ¯Λ andp ¯Σ molecular states are calculated for\nthe possible interpretations ofX(2075) andX(2085) in our previous work [19]. In realistic\nexperimental environments, however, resonance structures are often mixtures of multiple\n2hadron states with nearly degenerate masses and identical quantum numbers. Therefore,\nit is necessary to investigate other possible configurations in the same mass region. In\norder to fill the gap in the study of compact hexaquark states, in this work, a compact\nhexaquark configuration with a triquark-antitriquark structure is constructed, carrying a\ncolor configuration [3c]-[¯3c] and containing one strange quark, which is first proposed. This\nwork aims to explore whether this configuration could contribute to the structures ofX(2075)\nandX(2085).\nFrom the theoretical perspective, this work employs the method of QCD sum rules\n(QCDSR) [28, 29] to investigate exotic states. This approach was proposed in 1979 by\nShifman, Vainshtein, and Zakharov (SVZ) based on the first principles of QCD, and it pro-\nvides an efficient way to incorporate non-perturbative effects of the QCD vacuum. The\nQCDSR framework allows one to obtain analytical results for hadronic observables such as\nmasses [28–32], decay constants [33–37], and form factors [38–46]. For the hexaquark states\nunder consideration in this work, QCDSR has also been shown to provide reliable predictions\n[14, 15, 18].\nIn this work, ground-state compact hexaquark configurations of triquark–antitriquark\ntype with quantum numbersJ P = 0 −,0 +,1 −,1 + are constructed, yielding in total 24\npossible structures. Using QCDSR, their existence, masses, and decay constants are inves-\ntigated. Also, the results are compared with the experimental data. Furthermore, their\npossible decay modes are analyzed to provide guidance for experimental identification. The\npaper is organized as follows. In Sec.II, the interpolating currents that couple to these hex-\naquark states and outline the theoretical framework of QCDSR are constructed. In Sec.III,\nthe numerical methods and results are provided. Sec.IV is devoted to the discussion of\nthe possible decay modes of these hexaquark states. Finally, in Sec.V, our predictions are\ncompared with experimental observations, and our findings are summarized.\n3II. FORMALISM\nA. Choices of the Currents\nA triquark form (qq¯q) which consists of two quarks and one antiquark is considered in\nthis work. According to the decomposition of direct products in the color algebraSU(3)\n[¯3c]⊗[3 c]⊗[3 c] = [15c]⊕[ ¯6c]⊕[3 c]⊕[3 c],(1)\none can obtain the triquark configurations that form an overall color triplet. Subsequently,\naccording to the reduction of the colorSU(3) algebra\n[3c]⊗[ ¯3c] = [8c]⊕[1 c],(2)\nthe triquark structure in the color triplet representation [3 c] can combine with the antitri-\nquark structure in the color antitriplet representation [ ¯3c] to form a color-singlet bound\nhexaquark state.\nFirstly, the triquark current should be constructed. Following the above discussion, the\ninterpolating current for the triquark in the color triplet representation in the following form\nis constructed.\nηa = (¯qbΓ1qa)Γ2qb.(3)\nNext, the triquark–antitriquark currents containing two strange quarks are constructed.\nFollowing our previous studies on the statesp ¯Λ andp ¯Σ [19], the currents are defined as\nηa\n¯udu= (¯ubΓ1da)Γ2ub,(4)\nηa\n¯uds= (¯ubΓ1da)Γ2sb,(5)\nηa\n¯usd= (¯ubΓ1sa)Γ2db,(6)\nwhere Γ1 =1,Γ 2 = iγ5 correspond to the Type-I currents, while Γ1 = iγ5,Γ 2 =1correspond\nto the Type-II currents. Based on the above currents, two configurations of color-singlet\ntriquark-antitriquark interpolating currents containing one strange quark are provided:\n4•[3 c]qqq -[¯3c]qqs:\nj1(µ) = ¯ηa;¯udsΓ(µ)ηa\n¯udu; (7)\n•[3 c]qqq -[¯3c]qsq:\nj2(µ) = ¯ηa;¯usdΓ(µ)ηa\n¯udu; (8)\nwhere Γ(µ) =1,iγ 5, γµ, γµγ5 correspond to the four quantum numbersJ P = 0+,0 −,1 −,1 +,\nrespectively. By further considering both Type-I and Type-II currents, a total of 16 possible\nhexaquark states are obtained.\nB. 2-point Correlation Functions\nAfter selecting the interpolating currents (7) and (8), the two-point correlation functions\ncan be calculated, which are defined as\nΠ(q2) = i\nZ\nd4xe iq·x ⟨Ω|T{j(x), j†(0)}|Ω⟩,(9)\nΠµν(q2) = i\nZ\nd4xe iq·x ⟨Ω|T{j µ(x), j†\nν(0)}|Ω⟩,(10)\nwherej(x) andj µ(x) denote the interpolating currents corresponding to the hexaquark\nstates withJ= 0 andJ= 1, respectively, and|Ω⟩represents the physical QCD vacuum.\nThe two-point correlation function of the tensor type Πµν(q2) contains contributions from\nboth spin-0 and spin-1 degrees of freedom, and can be decomposed as\nΠµν(q2) =−\n\u0012\ngµν − qµqν\nq2\n\u0013\nΠ1(q2) + qµqν\nq2 Π0(q2),(11)\nwhere the subscripts 1 and 0 correspond to spin-1 and spin-0 states, respectively. By applying\na projection, the spin-0 contribution can be removed, obtaining\nΠ1(q2) =− 1\n3\n\u0012\ngµν − qµqν\nq2\n\u0013\nΠµν(q2),(12)\nwhich corresponds to the two-point correlation function of theJ= 1 hexaquark states.\n51. OPE Side\nThe correlation functions for the three configurations can be explicitly expressed as follows\nbased on the Wick’s theorem, :\n•[3 c]qqq -[¯3c]qqs:\nΠ1(µν)(q2) =\nZ\n[Dx] Tr\n\u0002\nSc1c\ns (−x)Γ2Γ(µ)Γ2Sbb1\nq (x)Γ2Γ(ν)Γ2\n\u0003\n×Tr\n\u0002\nSa1a\nq (−x)Γ1Scc1\nq (x)Γ1\n\u0003\nTr\n\u0002\nSaa1\nq (x)Γ1Sb1b\nq (−x)Γ1\n\u0003\n;\n(13)\n•[3 c]qqq -[¯3c]qsq:\nΠ2(µν)(q2) =\nZ\n[Dx] Tr\n\u0002\nSc1c\nq (−x)Γ2Γ(µ)Γ2Sbb1\nq (x)Γ2Γ(ν)Γ2\n\u0003\n×Tr\n\u0002\nSa1a\ns (−x)Γ1Scc1\nq (x)Γ1\n\u0003\nTr\n\u0002\nSaa1\nq (x)Γ1Sb1b\nq (−x)Γ1\n\u0003\n;\n(14)\nwhere the shorthand notation\nR\n[Dx] =−i\nR\nd4xhas been introduced. In our calculation, the\nlimitm u =m d →0 is taken such that isospin symmetry is preserved and no distinction is\nmade between the two light flavorsq=u, d. The quantitiesS ab\nq/s denote the full propagators\nof theu, dquarks and thesquark, respectively, whose explicit expressions are given as\nfollows:\niSjk\nq (x) =iδjk / x\n2π2x4 −δ jkmq\n1\n4π2x2 −it jk\na\nGa\nαβ\n32π2x2\n\u0000\nσαβ/ x+/ xσαβ\u0001\n−δ jk ⟨¯qq⟩\n12 + iδjk / x\n48mq⟨¯qq⟩\n−δ jk x2\n192⟨gs ¯qσ·Gq⟩+ iδ jk x2/ x\n1152mq⟨gs ¯qσ·Gq⟩ −tjk\na\nσαβ\n192⟨gs ¯qσ·Gq⟩\n−it jk\na\n1\n768 (σαβ/ x+/ xσαβ)m q⟨gs ¯qσ·Gq⟩.\n(15)\nHere, both perturbative and non-perturbative contributions at all orders of vacuum conden-\nsates are incorporated. More details on the full propagator can refer to Refs. [47, 48].\nAccording to the full propagator (15) and isospin symmetry, theJ P = 0+ states of the\nconfigurations [3c]qqq -[¯3c]qqs and [3c]qqq -[¯3c]qsq for the Type-I currents are in fact the same\nstate. Similarly, theJ P = 0− states of these two configurations for the Type-II currents are\nalso identical. Their two-point correlation functions are exactly the same and needlessly to be\ndistinguished. After these considerations, the number of possible nondegenerate hexaquark\n6states whose mass spectra need to be calculated is reduced to 14. The configurations of\nthese two types currents are presented in Table.I.\nJP Type-I currents Type-II currents\n0+ [3c]qqq -[¯3c]qqs [3c]qqq -[¯3c]qqs, [3c]qqq -[¯3c]qsq\n0− [3c]qqq -[¯3c]qqs, [3c]qqq -[¯3c]qsq [3c]qqq -[¯3c]qqs\n1− [3c]qqq -[¯3c]qqs, [3c]qqq -[¯3c]qsq [3c]qqq -[¯3c]qqs, [3c]qqq -[¯3c]qsq\n1+ [3c]qqq -[¯3c]qqs, [3c]qqq -[¯3c]qsq [3c]qqq -[¯3c]qqs, [3c]qqq -[¯3c]qsq\nTABLE I: Independent hexaquark states after considering isospin symmetry and\ndegeneracies.\nThrough the K¨ all´ en-Lehmann spectral representation\nρ(s) = 1\nπ Im Π(s),(16)\none can correspond the correlation functions given in Eqs.(13)-(14) to the spectral den-\nsity and derive the spectral density in the form of the operator product expansion (OPE),\nwhich separates and factorizes the contribution from short distance (Wilson coefficients) and\nlong distance (vacuum condensates). The spectral density in this work are retained up to\ndimension-13 operators, which can generally be expressed as\nρOPE(s) =ρpert(s) +ρ ⟨¯qq⟩(s) +ρ ⟨G2⟩(s) +ρ ⟨¯qGq⟩(s) +ρ ⟨¯qq⟩2\n(s) +ρ ⟨G3⟩(s) +ρ ⟨¯qq⟩⟨G2⟩(s)\n+ρ⟨¯qq⟩⟨¯qGq⟩(s) +ρ ⟨G4⟩(s) +ρ ⟨¯qq⟩3\n(s) +ρ ⟨¯qGq⟩⟨G2⟩(s) +ρ ⟨¯qq⟩2⟨G2⟩(s) +ρ ⟨¯qGq⟩2\n(s)\n+ρ⟨¯qq⟩2⟨¯qGq⟩(s) +ρ ⟨¯qq⟩⟨G4⟩(s) +ρ ⟨¯qq⟩4\n(s) +ρ ⟨¯qq⟩⟨¯qGq⟩⟨G2⟩(s) +ρ ⟨¯qq⟩⟨¯qGq⟩2\n(s)\n+ρ⟨¯qGq⟩⟨G4⟩(s).\n(17)\nSubsequently, through the dispersion relation, the spectral density on the OPE side can be\nused to express the correlation function Π OPE\nX,JP (q2) as\nΠOPE\nX,JP (q2) =\nZ ∞\nsmin\nds\nρOPE\nX,JP (s)\ns−q 2 ,(18)\nwhereXdenotes the corresponding ground hadronic state andJ P denotes its quantum\nnumber;s min represents the kinematic threshold, typically corresponding to the sum of the\n7masses of all quarks involved in the hadronic interpolating current [14, 31, 32], i.e.smin =m 2\ns\nfor these hexaquark states with one strange quark. The analytical results ofρ OPE\nX,JP (s) are\nshown in the appendices.\n2. Phenomenological Side\nIn the phenomenological framework, the contributions from the ground state and the\nexcited states (including the continuum spectrum) can be separated as\nρPhen\nX,JP (s) =λ 2\nX,JP δ\n\u0000\ns−m 2\nX,JP\n\u0001\n+θ(s−s 0)ρ X,JP (s),(19)\nwhereλ X,JP andm X,JP denote the decay constant and the mass of the ground state, respec-\ntively, ands 0 is the threshold parameter, which characterizes the onset of the excited states\nand the continuum spectrum.\nBy applying the dispersion relation, the phenomenological representation of the correla-\ntion function can be written as\nΠPhen\nX,JP (q2) =\nλ2\nX,JP\nm2\nX,JP −q 2 +\nZ ∞\ns0\nds ρX,JP (s)\ns−q 2 ,(20)\nwhere the first term corresponds to the pole contribution of the ground state, while the\nsecond term accounts for the contributions from the excited states and the continuum spec-\ntrum.\nC. Hadronic Mass and Decay Constant\nAccording to the hypothesis of quark-hadron duality, the correlation functions obtained\nfrom the OPE representation and the phenomenological representation should be consis-\ntence. In particular, the spectral densities from the two sides are expected to be approxi-\nmately equal above the continuum threshold parameters 0. Based on this assumption, we\ncan combine Eqs. (18) and (20). By performing a Borel transformation on both sides of\nthe equation, the contributions from the excited states and the continuum spectrum are\n8exponentially suppressed, leading to\nλ2\nX,JP e\n−m2\nX,JP /M2\nB =\nZ s0\nsmin\nds ρOPE\nX,JP (s) e−s/M2\nB .(21)\nFrom the sum rule given in Eq. (21), the mass of the ground-state hadronXcan be\nexpressed as\nmX,JP (s0, M2\nB) =\ns\n−LX,JP ,1(s0, M2\nB)\nLX,JP ,0(s0, M2\nB),(22)\nwhere\nLX,JP ,0(s0, M2\nB) =\nZ s0\nsmin\nds ρOPE(s) e−s/M2\nB + Πsum(M2\nB),\nLX,JP ,1(s0, M2\nB) = ∂\n∂(M −2\nB )LX,JP ,0(s0, M2\nB).\n(23)\nHere, Π sum(M2\nB) represents the part of the correlation function that originally has no\nimaginary part but provides non-trivial contribution after the Borel transformation. This\ncontribution is proportional to the masses of the lightuanddquarks. Since the light-quark\nlimitm u =m d →0 is taken, this term vanishes in our expressions.\nFurthermore, the decay constant can be extracted from Eq. (21) as\nλX,JP (s0, M2\nB) =\nq\ne\nm2\nX,JP (s0,M2\nB)/M2\nB LX,JP ,0(s0, M2\nB).(24)\nIII. NUMERICAL ANALYSIS\nIn the numerical calculations of QCDSR, the following input parameters are adopted\n[14, 49, 50], whereqrepresents theu, dquarks:\n⟨¯qq⟩=−(0.24±0.01) 3 GeV3,⟨¯ss⟩= (1.15±0.12)⟨¯qq⟩,\n⟨g2\ns G2⟩= (0.88±0.25) GeV 4,⟨g 3\ns G3⟩= (0.045±0.013) GeV 6,\n⟨¯qgsσ·Gq⟩=m 2\n0⟨¯qq⟩,⟨¯sg sσ·Gs⟩=m 2\n0⟨¯ss⟩,\nm2\n0 = (0.8±0.1) GeV 2, m s = (95±5) MeV.\n(25)\nIn constructing the QCDSR, two extra parameters,s 0 andM B, are introduced. Since\nthe hadron mass (m X) and the decay constant (λ X) are objective physical observables,\ntheir values should not depend on these parameters. Therefore, it is necessary to determine\n9an appropriate parameter region in which the dependence ofm X andλ X on the Borel\nparameters is minimized, such that the corresponding curves remain as stable as possible.\nThis region is referred to as the Borel window. To identify a suitable Borel window, two\nassumptions are imposed. First, since the hadronic state under investigation is the ground\nstate, its contribution to the spectral density should be dominant, while the contributions\nfrom excited states and the continuum spectra in the high-sregion should be as small as\npossible. According to Eq.(23), the contribution to the spectral density froms≫M 2\nB should\nbe significantly suppressed, which was also discussed in Refs.[51–53]. Therefore, the fraction\nof pole contribution can be defined as\nRPC\nX,JP = LX,JP ,0(s0, M2\nB)\nLX,JP ,0(∞, M2\nB).(26)\nFor the hexaquark states, since the spectral densityρ(s) contains higher powers ofs, the pole\ncontribution is relatively smaller compared to the tetraquark and pentaquark states, which is\nassumed to be no less than 15% [14, 16, 21, 51–53]. Secondly, the OPE should be convergent,\ni.e., the contribution of the highest-dimensional condensates to the spectral density should be\nas small as possible. In this work, we have taken into account the condensate contributions\nup to dimension 13 operators. The ratio of the dimension 13 condensate contribution is\ndefined as\nROPE\nX,JP =\n\f\f\f\f\f\nL⟨O13⟩\nX,JP ,0(s0, M2\nB)\nLX,JP ,0(s0, M2\nB)\n\f\f\f\f\f,(27)\nwhere\nL⟨O13⟩\nX,JP ,0(s0, M2\nB) =\nZ s0\nsmin\nds ρ⟨O13⟩(s)e−s/M2\nB .(28)\nTo determine the appropriate range of the threshold parameters 0, the method adopted\nin Refs.[14, 31, 32, 54, 55] are followed. Since √s0 represents the energy scale at which the\ncontinuum contribution begins, it should be slightly larger than the ground-state hadron\nmassm X, i.e.,√s0 ∼m X +δ ,where the typical value ofδlies within 0.4–0.8 GeV [14, 49, 56].\nWithin this range ofs 0, a suitable range ofM B in which the curve ofm X/λX −M 2\nB remains\nas stable and linear as possible can be searched. The overlapping region ofs 0 andM B\nobtained in this way defines the Borel window, which corresponds to the physically allowed\nparameter space for the hadronic state under investigation. In practice, an uncertainty of\nabout±0.1 GeV for √s0 is allowed, while the range ofM 2\nB should exceed 0.5 GeV2 to ensure\n10sufficient stability of the Borel window.\nAs a result, six possible independent hexaquark states can be obtained. These include one\n0+ state and two 1+ states corresponding to the Type-I currents, as well as one 0− state and\ntwo 1− states corresponding to the Type-II currents. For the other eight hexaquark states,\nno stable Borel window can be found regardless of the variation ofs 0 andM B, indicating\nthat the chosen interpolating currents do not couple well to the corresponding hexaquark\nconfigurations. The relevant numerical results are summarized in Table.II. Figs.1–6 (a)–(d)\ndisplay the dependence ofR PC\nX,JP ,R OPE\nX,JP , the massM X,JP , and the decay constantλ X,JP on\nM2\nB for different choices ofs 0 for these six independent hexaquark states. From Table. II,\nit can be seen that both the masses and the decay constants of the hexaquark states carry\ncertain uncertainties. These uncertainties arise mainly from the input parameters, such as\nthe quark masses and vacuum condensates, as well as from the choice of the parameterss 0\nandM B.\nCurrentsJ P Configurations √s0(GeV)M 2\nB(GeV2)m X(GeV)λ X(10−5GeV8)R PC(%)R OPE(%)\nType-I 0 + [3c]qqq -[¯3c]qqs 2.9±0.1 2.4−2.9 1.99±0.02 3.21±0.05 27−81 3.6−4.1\n1+ [3c]qqq -[¯3c]qqs 2.9±0.1 2.3−3.0 1.97±0.03 2.84±0.05 18−90 3.5−4.3\n[3c]qqq -[¯3c]qsq 2.9±0.1 2.3−2.9 1.97±0.02 2.83±0.04 23−88 3.2−3.8\nType-II 0 − [3c]qqq -[¯3c]qqs 2.8±0.1 1.6−2.2 1.84±0.21 2.38±0.56 17−62 2.2−3.3\n1− [3c]qqq -[¯3c]qqs 2.9±0.1 1.8−2.3 2.01±0.20 2.84±0.70 16−49 2.8−4.4\n[3c]qqq -[¯3c]qsq 2.9±0.1 1.8−2.3 2.02±0.20 2.81±0.69 16−49 1.6−2.4\nTABLE II: Numerical results of the 6 possible independent and nondegenerate hexaquark\nstates.\nIV. DECAY MODES ANALYSES\nIn realistic experimental environments, the observed hadronic states are usually not pure\nstates, but rather mixtures of several hadrons with nearly degenerate masses and identi-\ncal quantum numbers (such asJ P and strange numbers). To distinguish these states, it\nis essential to analyze their decay patterns. In this section, the possible decay modes of\nthe hexaquark states obtained in our calculations are provided, with the expectation that\nongoing experiments such as BESIII and Belle-II may be able to search for them.\n11The dominant strong decay channels are summarized in Table.III. Since the central values\nof the calculated hexaquark masses lie below the thresholds ofp ¯Λ andp ¯Σ, decays into these\ntwo baryons are forbidden. However, once uncertainties are taken into account, theJ P = 1−\nhexaquark states may allow for such decay channels. Therefore, these two decay patterns\nare also listed in parentheses in Table.III. Furthermore, thep ¯Λ andp ¯Σ molecular state is\nmore prone to directly decay intop+ ¯Λ orp+ ¯Σ, because it consists of two loosely bound\nbaryon-antibaryon clusters, and thus is less stable compared to the compact hexaquark state.\nDecays into three-meson final states are expected to dominate [14, 19], since the thresholds\nof these final states are smaller than the masses of hexaquark states. In addition, these\ntwo types of hexaquark configurations can also undergo weak decays, such as transitions to\na nucleon–antinucleon pairN ¯N. However, such processes involve the Cabibbo-suppressed\ntransitions→u, making them much more difficult to observe compared to the strong\ndecays.\ns0 =2.8 GeV\ns0 =2.9 GeV\ns0 =3.0 GeV\n2.4 2.5 2.6 2.7 2.8 2.9\n0.0\n0.2\n0.4\n0.6\n0.8\n1.0\nMB\n2(GeV2)\nR0+\nPC [3c]qqq-[3c]\n_\nqqs\n(a)\ns0 =2.8 GeV\ns0 =2.9 GeV\ns0 =3.0 GeV\n2.4 2.5 2.6 2.7 2.8 2.9\n0.020\n0.025\n0.030\n0.035\n0.040\n0.045\n0.050\n0.055\n0.060\nMB\n2(GeV2)\nR0+\nOPE [3c]qqq-[3c]\n_\nqqs (b)\ns0 =2.8 GeV\ns0 =2.9 GeV\ns0 =3.0 GeV\n2.4 2.5 2.6 2.7 2.8 2.9\n1.8\n1.9\n2.0\n2.1\n2.2\nMB\n2(GeV2)\nM0+\n[3c]qqq-[3c]\n_\nqqs\n(GeV)\n(c)\ns0 =2.8 GeV\ns0 =2.9 GeV\ns0 =3.0 GeV\n2.4 2.5 2.6 2.7 2.8 2.9\n0.000020\n0.000025\n0.000030\n0.000035\n0.000040\nMB\n2(GeV2)\nλ0+\n[3c]qqq-[3c]\n_\nqqs\n(GeV8) (d)\nFIG. 1: The figures forJ P = 0+ [3c]qqq -[¯3c]qqs (or [3c]qqq -[¯3c]qsq) hexaquark states.\n12s0 =2.8 GeV\ns0 =2.9 GeV\ns0 =3.0 GeV\n2.3 2.4 2.5 2.6 2.7 2.8 2.9 3.0\n0.0\n0.2\n0.4\n0.6\n0.8\n1.0\nMB\n2(GeV2)\nR1+\nPC [3c]qqq-[3c]\n_\nqqs\n(a)\ns0 =2.8 GeV\ns0 =2.9 GeV\ns0 =3.0 GeV\n2.3 2.4 2.5 2.6 2.7 2.8 2.9 3.0\n0.020\n0.025\n0.030\n0.035\n0.040\n0.045\n0.050\n0.055\n0.060\nMB\n2(GeV2)\nR1+\nOPE [3c]qqq-[3c]\n_\nqqs (b)\ns0 =2.8 GeV\ns0 =2.9 GeV\ns0 =3.0 GeV\n2.3 2.4 2.5 2.6 2.7 2.8 2.9 3.0\n1.8\n1.9\n2.0\n2.1\n2.2\nMB\n2(GeV2)\nM1+\n[3c]qqq-[3c]\n_\nqqs\n(GeV)\n(c)\ns0 =2.8 GeV\ns0 =2.9 GeV\ns0 =3.0 GeV\n2.3 2.4 2.5 2.6 2.7 2.8 2.9 3.0\n0.00001\n0.00002\n0.00003\n0.00004\n0.00005\n0.00006\nMB\n2(GeV2)\nλ1+\n[3c]qqq-[3c]\n_\nqqs\n(GeV8) (d)\nFIG. 2: The figures forJ P = 1+ [3c]qqq -[¯3c]qqs hexaquark state.\ns0 =2.8 GeV\ns0 =2.9 GeV\ns0 =3.0 GeV\n2.3 2.4 2.5 2.6 2.7 2.8 2.9\n0.0\n0.2\n0.4\n0.6\n0.8\n1.0\nMB\n2(GeV2)\nR1+\nPC [3c]qqq-[3c]\n_\nqsq\n(a)\ns0 =2.8 GeV\ns0 =2.9 GeV\ns0 =3.0 GeV\n2.3 2.4 2.5 2.6 2.7 2.8 2.9\n0.00\n0.01\n0.02\n0.03\n0.04\n0.05\n0.06\nMB\n2(GeV2)\nR1+\nOPE [3c]qqq-[3c]\n_\nqsq (b)\ns0 =2.8 GeV\ns0 =2.9 GeV\ns0 =3.0 GeV\n2.3 2.4 2.5 2.6 2.7 2.8 2.9\n1.8\n1.9\n2.0\n2.1\n2.2\nMB\n2(GeV2)\nM1+\n[3c]qqq-[3c]\n_\nqsq\n(GeV)\n(c)\ns0 =2.8 GeV\ns0 =2.9 GeV\ns0 =3.0 GeV\n2.3 2.4 2.5 2.6 2.7 2.8 2.9\n0.00001\n0.00002\n0.00003\n0.00004\n0.00005\nMB\n2(GeV2)\nλ1+\n[3c]qqq-[3c]\n_\nqsq\n(GeV8) (d)\nFIG. 3: The figures forJ P = 1+ [3c]qqq -[¯3c]qsq hexaquark states.\n13s0 =2.7 GeV\ns0 =2.8 GeV\ns0 =2.9 GeV\n1.6 1.7 1.8 1.9 2.0 2.1 2.2\n0.0\n0.2\n0.4\n0.6\n0.8\n1.0\nMB\n2(GeV2)\nR0-\nPC [3c]qqq-[3c]\n_\nqqs\n(a)\ns0 =2.7 GeV\ns0 =2.8 GeV\ns0 =2.9 GeV\n1.6 1.7 1.8 1.9 2.0 2.1 2.2\n0.00\n0.01\n0.02\n0.03\n0.04\nMB\n2(GeV2)\nR0-\nOPE [3c]qqq-[3c]\n_\nqqs (b)\ns0 =2.7 GeV\ns0 =2.8 GeV\ns0 =2.9 GeV\n1.6 1.7 1.8 1.9 2.0 2.1 2.2\n1.0\n1.5\n2.0\n2.5\n3.0\nMB\n2(GeV2)\nM0-\n[3c]qqq-[3c]\n_\nqqs\n(GeV)\n(c)\ns0 =2.7 GeV\ns0 =2.8 GeV\ns0 =2.9 GeV\n1.6 1.7 1.8 1.9 2.0 2.1 2.2\n0.00002\n0.00004\n0.00006\n0.00008\n0.00010\nMB\n2(GeV2)\nλ0-\n[3c]qqq-[3c]\n_\nqqs\n(GeV8) (d)\nFIG. 4: The figures forJ P = 0− [3c]qqq -[¯3c]qqs (or [3c]qqq -[¯3c]qsq) hexaquark states.\ns0 =2.8 GeV\ns0 =2.9 GeV\ns0 =3.0 GeV\n1.8 1.9 2.0 2.1 2.2 2.3\n0.0\n0.2\n0.4\n0.6\n0.8\n1.0\nMB\n2(GeV2)\nR1-\nPC [3c]qqq-[3c]\n_\nqqs\n(a)\ns0 =2.8 GeV\ns0 =2.9 GeV\ns0 =3.0 GeV\n1.8 1.9 2.0 2.1 2.2 2.3\n0.00\n0.02\n0.04\n0.06\n0.08\n0.10\nMB\n2(GeV2)\nR1-\nOPE [3c]qqq-[3c]\n_\nqqs (b)\ns0 =2.8 GeV\ns0 =2.9 GeV\ns0 =3.0 GeV\n1.8 1.9 2.0 2.1 2.2 2.3\n1.0\n1.5\n2.0\n2.5\n3.0\nMB\n2(GeV2)\nM1-\n[3c]qqq-[3c]\n_\nqqs\n(GeV)\n(c)\ns0 =2.8 GeV\ns0 =2.9 GeV\ns0 =3.0 GeV\n1.8 1.9 2.0 2.1 2.2 2.3\n0.00002\n0.00004\n0.00006\n0.00008\n0.00010\nMB\n2(GeV2)\nλ1-\n[3c]qqq-[3c]\n_\nqqs\n(GeV8) (d)\nFIG. 5: The figures forJ P = 1− [3c]qqq -[¯3c]qqs hexaquark state.\n14s0 =2.8 GeV\ns0 =2.9 GeV\ns0 =3.0 GeV\n1.8 1.9 2.0 2.1 2.2 2.3\n0.0\n0.2\n0.4\n0.6\n0.8\n1.0\nMB\n2(GeV2)\nR1-\nPC [3c]qqq-[3c]\n_\nqsq\n(a)\ns0 =2.8 GeV\ns0 =2.9 GeV\ns0 =3.0 GeV\n1.8 1.9 2.0 2.1 2.2 2.3\n0.00\n0.01\n0.02\n0.03\n0.04\n0.05\nMB\n2(GeV2)\nR1-\nOPE [3c]qqq-[3c]\n_\nqsq (b)\ns0 =2.8 GeV\ns0 =2.9 GeV\ns0 =3.0 GeV\n1.8 1.9 2.0 2.1 2.2 2.3\n1.0\n1.5\n2.0\n2.5\n3.0\nMB\n2(GeV2)\nM1-\n[3c]qqq-[3c]\n_\nqsq\n(GeV)\n(c)\ns0 =2.8 GeV\ns0 =2.9 GeV\ns0 =3.0 GeV\n1.8 1.9 2.0 2.1 2.2 2.3\n0.00002\n0.00004\n0.00006\n0.00008\n0.00010\nMB\n2(GeV2)\nλ1-\n[3c]qqq-[3c]\n_\nqsq\n(GeV8) (d)\nFIG. 6: The figures forJ P = 1− [3c]qqq -[¯3c]qsq hexaquark states.\nJP 0− 0+ 1− 1+\n[3c]qqq -[¯3c]qqs ππK,ωωK ππK ∗,ωωK ∗ ππK ∗,ωωK ∗ ππK ∗,ωωK ∗\nπρK πρK(p ¯Λ/p¯Σ)πρK\n[3c]qqq -[¯3c]qsq ππK,ωωK ππK ∗,ωωK ∗ ππK ∗,ωωK ∗ ππK ∗,ωωK ∗\nπρK πρK(p ¯Λ/p¯Σ)πρK\nTABLE III: Typical decay modes of the hexaquark states for each quantum number.\nV. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS\nIn this work, we explore the compact hexaquark states constructed from two different\ntriquark currents, in which the only two possible configurations, [3 c]qqq -[¯3c]qqs and [3 c]qqq -\n[¯3c]qsq with quantum numbersJ P = 0 −,0 +,1 −,1 + are taken into account. Their masses\nand decay constants are calculated within the QCDSR framework. The results indicate\nthe probable existence of six independent hexaquark states. The possible decay modes of\nthese six hexaquark states are analyzed, including both strong and weak decay channels.\n15These predicted decay patterns provide a theoretical basis for their potential identification\nin ongoing experiments such as BESIII and Belle-II.\nPhenomenologically, one can find that the mass ofX(2075) lies within the predicted range\nof theJ P = 1− hexaquark states in [3c]qqq -[¯3c]qqs and [3c]qqq -[¯3c]qsq configurations, suggesting\nthatX(2075) may contain such hexaquark components. In contrast, the mass ofX(2085)\ndoes not fall into the predicted region for theJ P = 1+ hexaquark states considered here,\nimplying that its internal structure cannot be explained by the present configurations alone.\nTo clarify the nature ofX(2085), a more comprehensive analysis is desirable that includes a\nmixture of interpolating currents in Eqs. (7)–(8) and other possible configurations, such as\ncurrents in Ref. [19]. Moreover, the two compact hexaquark states predicted in this work\nwith quantum numbersJ P = 0+ andJ P = 0− can serve as candidate for the open strange\nhadrons near 2 GeV.\nFinally, this study provides a further theoretical insight to the spectroscopy of multiquark\nsystem. The molecular and multiquark structures may coexist, which pose a challenge to us\nin deciphering the exotic states.\nAcknowledgments\nThis work was supported in part by the National Key Research and Development Pro-\ngram of China under Contracts No. 2020YFA0406400, by the National Natural Science\nFoundation of China(NSFC) under the Grants 12475087 and 12235008.\n[1] S.

INTRODUCTION\nThe discovery of theX(3872) resonance at theD 0 ¯D∗0 threshold by the Belle II Col-\nlaboration in 2003 [1] inaugurated a new era in hadron spectroscopy, prompting extensive\nexperimental and theoretical efforts that have uncovered a growing number of candidate\nexotic states. Systematic identification and characterization of these states are essential\nbecause they furnish stringent tests of quantum chromodynamics (QCD) in the nonpertur-\nbative regime and illuminate the mechanisms of color confinement and multiquark dynamics.\nTherefore, continued discovery and detailed study of exotic hadronic states remain central\ngoals for both experiment and theory.\nOver the past two decades, numerous tetraquark and pentaquark candidates have been\nfirmly established [2–5]. Against this backdrop, conducting the exploration for hexaquark\nsystem is a natural and necessary extension of hadron spectroscopy. The investigation\nof hexaquark states has a long-standing history. As early as the 1940s, proposals were\nadvanced to interpret the pion as composite systems formed from nucleon-antinucleon pairs,\nreflecting early interest in multiquark configurations. More recently, the observations of a\nseries of states near thep¯pthreshold, such asX(1860) [6],X(1835) [7],X(1840) [8], and\nX(1880) [9], have rekindled and intensified efforts to search for and characterize hexaquark\ncandidates [10–25]. Current theoretical investigations for hexaquark states have mainly\nfocused on its molecular configuration, while studies for compact hexaquark states remain\ncomparatively scarce. However, to gain a complete understanding of exotic hadron states, it\nis essential to explore compact multiquark configurations that complement molecular states\nand may even be more fundamental.\nThe arrangements of a hexaquark system can include dibaryon (bound states of two\nbaryons), baryonium (bound states of baryon–antibaryon), and bound states formed by three\nmesons. Among the baryoniums, a special topology is that the baryon and the antibaryon are\nnot particle-antiparticle conjugates, such as the proton-antihyperon (p-¯Λ) bound state, which\nlead to the existence of a broader range of exotic states. Experimental evidence for this novel\narrangement includes the resonancesX(2075) andX(2085), which are both observed in the\np¯Λ final state [26, 27]. The mass spectra of thep ¯Λ andp ¯Σ molecular states are calculated for\nthe possible interpretations ofX(2075) andX(2085) in our previous work [19]. In realistic\nexperimental environments, however, resonance structures are often mixtures of multiple\n2hadron states with nearly degenerate masses and identical quantum numbers. Therefore,\nit is necessary to investigate other possible configurations in the same mass region. In\norder to fill the gap in the study of compact hexaquark states, in this work, a compact\nhexaquark configuration with a triquark-antitriquark structure is constructed, carrying a\ncolor configuration [3c]-[¯3c] and containing one strange quark, which is first proposed. This\nwork aims to explore whether this configuration could contribute to the structures ofX(2075)\nandX(2085).\nFrom the theoretical perspective, this work employs the method of QCD sum rules\n(QCDSR) [28, 29] to investigate exotic states. This approach was proposed in 1979 by\nShifman, Vainshtein, and Zakharov (SVZ) based on the first principles of QCD, and it pro-\nvides an efficient way to incorporate non-perturbative effects of the QCD vacuum. The\nQCDSR framework allows one to obtain analytical results for hadronic observables such as\nmasses [28–32], decay constants [33–37], and form factors [38–46]. For the hexaquark states\nunder consideration in this work, QCDSR has also been shown to provide reliable predictions\n[14, 15, 18].\nIn this work, ground-state compact hexaquark configurations of triquark–antitriquark\ntype with quantum numbersJ P = 0 −,0 +,1 −,1 + are constructed, yielding in total 24\npossible structures. Using QCDSR, their existence, masses, and decay constants are inves-\ntigated. Also, the results are compared with the experimental data. Furthermore, their\npossible decay modes are analyzed to provide guidance for experimental identification. The\npaper is organized as follows. In Sec.II, the interpolating currents that couple to these hex-\naquark states and outline the theoretical framework of QCDSR are constructed. In Sec.III,\nthe numerical methods and results are provided. Sec.IV is devoted to the discussion of\nthe possible decay modes of these hexaquark states. Finally, in Sec.V, our predictions are\ncompared with experimental observations, and our findings are summarized.\n3II. FORMALISM\nA. Choices of the Currents\nA triquark form (qq¯q) which consists of two quarks and one antiquark is considered in\nthis work. According to the decomposition of direct products in the color algebraSU(3)\n[¯3c]⊗[3 c]⊗[3 c] = [15c]⊕[ ¯6c]⊕[3 c]⊕[3 c],(1)\none can obtain the triquark configurations that form an overall color triplet. Subsequently,\naccording to the reduction of the colorSU(3) algebra\n[3c]⊗[ ¯3c] = [8c]⊕[1 c],(2)\nthe triquark structure in the color triplet representation [3 c] can combine with the antitri-\nquark structure in the color antitriplet representation [ ¯3c] to form a color-singlet bound\nhexaquark state.\nFirstly, the triquark current should be constructed. Following the above discussion, the\ninterpolating current for the triquark in the color triplet representation in the following form\nis constructed.\nηa = (¯qbΓ1qa)Γ2qb.(3)\nNext, the triquark–antitriquark currents containing two strange quarks are constructed.\nFollowing our previous studies on the statesp ¯Λ andp ¯Σ [19], the currents are defined as\nηa\n¯udu= (¯ubΓ1da)Γ2ub,(4)\nηa\n¯uds= (¯ubΓ1da)Γ2sb,(5)\nηa\n¯usd= (¯ubΓ1sa)Γ2db,(6)\nwhere Γ1 =1,Γ 2 = iγ5 correspond to the Type-I currents, while Γ1 = iγ5,Γ 2 =1correspond\nto the Type-II currents. Based on the above currents, two configurations of color-singlet\ntriquark-antitriquark interpolating currents containing one strange quark are provided:\n4•[3 c]qqq -[¯3c]qqs:\nj1(µ) = ¯ηa;¯udsΓ(µ)ηa\n¯udu; (7)\n•[3 c]qqq -[¯3c]qsq:\nj2(µ) = ¯ηa;¯usdΓ(µ)ηa\n¯udu; (8)\nwhere Γ(µ) =1,iγ 5, γµ, γµγ5 correspond to the four quantum numbersJ P = 0+,0 −,1 −,1 +,\nrespectively. By further considering both Type-I and Type-II currents, a total of 16 possible\nhexaquark states are obtained.\nB. 2-point Correlation Functions\nAfter selecting the interpolating currents (7) and (8), the two-point correlation functions\ncan be calculated, which are defined as\nΠ(q2) = i\nZ\nd4xe iq·x ⟨Ω|T{j(x), j†(0)}|Ω⟩,(9)\nΠµν(q2) = i\nZ\nd4xe iq·x ⟨Ω|T{j µ(x), j†\nν(0)}|Ω⟩,(10)\nwherej(x) andj µ(x) denote the interpolating currents corresponding to the hexaquark\nstates withJ= 0 andJ= 1, respectively, and|Ω⟩represents the physical QCD vacuum.\nThe two-point correlation function of the tensor type Πµν(q2) contains contributions from\nboth spin-0 and spin-1 degrees of freedom, and can be decomposed as\nΠµν(q2) =−\n\u0012\ngµν − qµqν\nq2\n\u0013\nΠ1(q2) + qµqν\nq2 Π0(q2),(11)\nwhere the subscripts 1 and 0 correspond to spin-1 and spin-0 states, respectively. By applying\na projection, the spin-0 contribution can be removed, obtaining\nΠ1(q2) =− 1\n3\n\u0012\ngµν − qµqν\nq2\n\u0013\nΠµν(q2),(12)\nwhich corresponds to the two-point correlation function of theJ= 1 hexaquark states.\n51. OPE Side\nThe correlation functions for the three configurations can be explicitly expressed as follows\nbased on the Wick’s theorem, :\n•[3 c]qqq -[¯3c]qqs:\nΠ1(µν)(q2) =\nZ\n[Dx] Tr\n\u0002\nSc1c\ns (−x)Γ2Γ(µ)Γ2Sbb1\nq (x)Γ2Γ(ν)Γ2\n\u0003\n×Tr\n\u0002\nSa1a\nq (−x)Γ1Scc1\nq (x)Γ1\n\u0003\nTr\n\u0002\nSaa1\nq (x)Γ1Sb1b\nq (−x)Γ1\n\u0003\n;\n(13)\n•[3 c]qqq -[¯3c]qsq:\nΠ2(µν)(q2) =\nZ\n[Dx] Tr\n\u0002\nSc1c\nq (−x)Γ2Γ(µ)Γ2Sbb1\nq (x)Γ2Γ(ν)Γ2\n\u0003\n×Tr\n\u0002\nSa1a\ns (−x)Γ1Scc1\nq (x)Γ1\n\u0003\nTr\n\u0002\nSaa1\nq (x)Γ1Sb1b\nq (−x)Γ1\n\u0003\n;\n(14)\nwhere the shorthand notation\nR\n[Dx] =−i\nR\nd4xhas been introduced. In our calculation, the\nlimitm u =m d →0 is taken such that isospin symmetry is preserved and no distinction is\nmade between the two light flavorsq=u, d. The quantitiesS ab\nq/s denote the full propagators\nof theu, dquarks and thesquark, respectively, whose explicit expressions are given as\nfollows:\niSjk\nq (x) =iδjk / x\n2π2x4 −δ jkmq\n1\n4π2x2 −it jk\na\nGa\nαβ\n32π2x2\n\u0000\nσαβ/ x+/ xσαβ\u0001\n−δ jk ⟨¯qq⟩\n12 + iδjk / x\n48mq⟨¯qq⟩\n−δ jk x2\n192⟨gs ¯qσ·Gq⟩+ iδ jk x2/ x\n1152mq⟨gs ¯qσ·Gq⟩ −tjk\na\nσαβ\n192⟨gs ¯qσ·Gq⟩\n−it jk\na\n1\n768 (σαβ/ x+/ xσαβ)m q⟨gs ¯qσ·Gq⟩.\n(15)\nHere, both perturbative and non-perturbative contributions at all orders of vacuum conden-\nsates are incorporated. More details on the full propagator can refer to Refs. [47, 48].\nAccording to the full propagator (15) and isospin symmetry, theJ P = 0+ states of the\nconfigurations [3c]qqq -[¯3c]qqs and [3c]qqq -[¯3c]qsq for the Type-I currents are in fact the same\nstate. Similarly, theJ P = 0− states of these two configurations for the Type-II currents are\nalso identical. Their two-point correlation functions are exactly the same and needlessly to be\ndistinguished. After these considerations, the number of possible nondegenerate hexaquark\n6states whose mass spectra need to be calculated is reduced to 14. The configurations of\nthese two types currents are presented in Table.I.\nJP Type-I currents Type-II currents\n0+ [3c]qqq -[¯3c]qqs [3c]qqq -[¯3c]qqs, [3c]qqq -[¯3c]qsq\n0− [3c]qqq -[¯3c]qqs, [3c]qqq -[¯3c]qsq [3c]qqq -[¯3c]qqs\n1− [3c]qqq -[¯3c]qqs, [3c]qqq -[¯3c]qsq [3c]qqq -[¯3c]qqs, [3c]qqq -[¯3c]qsq\n1+ [3c]qqq -[¯3c]qqs, [3c]qqq -[¯3c]qsq [3c]qqq -[¯3c]qqs, [3c]qqq -[¯3c]qsq\nTABLE I: Independent hexaquark states after considering isospin symmetry and\ndegeneracies.\nThrough the K¨ all´ en-Lehmann spectral representation\nρ(s) = 1\nπ Im Π(s),(16)\none can correspond the correlation functions given in Eqs.(13)-(14) to the spectral den-\nsity and derive the spectral density in the form of the operator product expansion (OPE),\nwhich separates and factorizes the contribution from short distance (Wilson coefficients) and\nlong distance (vacuum condensates). The spectral density in this work are retained up to\ndimension-13 operators, which can generally be expressed as\nρOPE(s) =ρpert(s) +ρ ⟨¯qq⟩(s) +ρ ⟨G2⟩(s) +ρ ⟨¯qGq⟩(s) +ρ ⟨¯qq⟩2\n(s) +ρ ⟨G3⟩(s) +ρ ⟨¯qq⟩⟨G2⟩(s)\n+ρ⟨¯qq⟩⟨¯qGq⟩(s) +ρ ⟨G4⟩(s) +ρ ⟨¯qq⟩3\n(s) +ρ ⟨¯qGq⟩⟨G2⟩(s) +ρ ⟨¯qq⟩2⟨G2⟩(s) +ρ ⟨¯qGq⟩2\n(s)\n+ρ⟨¯qq⟩2⟨¯qGq⟩(s) +ρ ⟨¯qq⟩⟨G4⟩(s) +ρ ⟨¯qq⟩4\n(s) +ρ ⟨¯qq⟩⟨¯qGq⟩⟨G2⟩(s) +ρ ⟨¯qq⟩⟨¯qGq⟩2\n(s)\n+ρ⟨¯qGq⟩⟨G4⟩(s).\n(17)\nSubsequently, through the dispersion relation, the spectral density on the OPE side can be\nused to express the correlation function Π OPE\nX,JP (q2) as\nΠOPE\nX,JP (q2) =\nZ ∞\nsmin\nds\nρOPE\nX,JP (s)\ns−q 2 ,(18)\nwhereXdenotes the corresponding ground hadronic state andJ P denotes its quantum\nnumber;s min represents the kinematic threshold, typically corresponding to the sum of the\n7masses of all quarks involved in the hadronic interpolating current [14, 31, 32], i.e.smin =m 2\ns\nfor these hexaquark states with one strange quark. The analytical results ofρ OPE\nX,JP (s) are\nshown in the appendices.\n2. Phenomenological Side\nIn the phenomenological framework, the contributions from the ground state and the\nexcited states (including the continuum spectrum) can be separated as\nρPhen\nX,JP (s) =λ 2\nX,JP δ\n\u0000\ns−m 2\nX,JP\n\u0001\n+θ(s−s 0)ρ X,JP (s),(19)\nwhereλ X,JP andm X,JP denote the decay constant and the mass of the ground state, respec-\ntively, ands 0 is the threshold parameter, which characterizes the onset of the excited states\nand the continuum spectrum.\nBy applying the dispersion relation, the phenomenological representation of the correla-\ntion function can be written as\nΠPhen\nX,JP (q2) =\nλ2\nX,JP\nm2\nX,JP −q 2 +\nZ ∞\ns0\nds ρX,JP (s)\ns−q 2 ,(20)\nwhere the first term corresponds to the pole contribution of the ground state, while the\nsecond term accounts for the contributions from the excited states and the continuum spec-\ntrum.\nC. Hadronic Mass and Decay Constant\nAccording to the hypothesis of quark-hadron duality, the correlation functions obtained\nfrom the OPE representation and the phenomenological representation should be consis-\ntence. In particular, the spectral densities from the two sides are expected to be approxi-\nmately equal above the continuum threshold parameters 0. Based on this assumption, we\ncan combine Eqs. (18) and (20). By performing a Borel transformation on both sides of\nthe equation, the contributions from the excited states and the continuum spectrum are\n8exponentially suppressed, leading to\nλ2\nX,JP e\n−m2\nX,JP /M2\nB =\nZ s0\nsmin\nds ρOPE\nX,JP (s) e−s/M2\nB .(21)\nFrom the sum rule given in Eq. (21), the mass of the ground-state hadronXcan be\nexpressed as\nmX,JP (s0, M2\nB) =\ns\n−LX,JP ,1(s0, M2\nB)\nLX,JP ,0(s0, M2\nB),(22)\nwhere\nLX,JP ,0(s0, M2\nB) =\nZ s0\nsmin\nds ρOPE(s) e−s/M2\nB + Πsum(M2\nB),\nLX,JP ,1(s0, M2\nB) = ∂\n∂(M −2\nB )LX,JP ,0(s0, M2\nB).\n(23)\nHere, Π sum(M2\nB) represents the part of the correlation function that originally has no\nimaginary part but provides non-trivial contribution after the Borel transformation. This\ncontribution is proportional to the masses of the lightuanddquarks. Since the light-quark\nlimitm u =m d →0 is taken, this term vanishes in our expressions.\nFurthermore, the decay constant can be extracted from Eq. (21) as\nλX,JP (s0, M2\nB) =\nq\ne\nm2\nX,JP (s0,M2\nB)/M2\nB LX,JP ,0(s0, M2\nB).(24)\nIII. NUMERICAL ANALYSIS\nIn the numerical calculations of QCDSR, the following input parameters are adopted\n[14, 49, 50], whereqrepresents theu, dquarks:\n⟨¯qq⟩=−(0.24±0.01) 3 GeV3,⟨¯ss⟩= (1.15±0.12)⟨¯qq⟩,\n⟨g2\ns G2⟩= (0.88±0.25) GeV 4,⟨g 3\ns G3⟩= (0.045±0.013) GeV 6,\n⟨¯qgsσ·Gq⟩=m 2\n0⟨¯qq⟩,⟨¯sg sσ·Gs⟩=m 2\n0⟨¯ss⟩,\nm2\n0 = (0.8±0.1) GeV 2, m s = (95±5) MeV.\n(25)\nIn constructing the QCDSR, two extra parameters,s 0 andM B, are introduced. Since\nthe hadron mass (m X) and the decay constant (λ X) are objective physical observables,\ntheir values should not depend on these parameters. Therefore, it is necessary to determine\n9an appropriate parameter region in which the dependence ofm X andλ X on the Borel\nparameters is minimized, such that the corresponding curves remain as stable as possible.\nThis region is referred to as the Borel window. To identify a suitable Borel window, two\nassumptions are imposed. First, since the hadronic state under investigation is the ground\nstate, its contribution to the spectral density should be dominant, while the contributions\nfrom excited states and the continuum spectra in the high-sregion should be as small as\npossible. According to Eq.(23), the contribution to the spectral density froms≫M 2\nB should\nbe significantly suppressed, which was also discussed in Refs.[51–53]. Therefore, the fraction\nof pole contribution can be defined as\nRPC\nX,JP = LX,JP ,0(s0, M2\nB)\nLX,JP ,0(∞, M2\nB).(26)\nFor the hexaquark states, since the spectral densityρ(s) contains higher powers ofs, the pole\ncontribution is relatively smaller compared to the tetraquark and pentaquark states, which is\nassumed to be no less than 15% [14, 16, 21, 51–53]. Secondly, the OPE should be convergent,\ni.e., the contribution of the highest-dimensional condensates to the spectral density should be\nas small as possible. In this work, we have taken into account the condensate contributions\nup to dimension 13 operators. The ratio of the dimension 13 condensate contribution is\ndefined as\nROPE\nX,JP =\n\f\f\f\f\f\nL⟨O13⟩\nX,JP ,0(s0, M2\nB)\nLX,JP ,0(s0, M2\nB)\n\f\f\f\f\f,(27)\nwhere\nL⟨O13⟩\nX,JP ,0(s0, M2\nB) =\nZ s0\nsmin\nds ρ⟨O13⟩(s)e−s/M2\nB .(28)\nTo determine the appropriate range of the threshold parameters 0, the method adopted\nin Refs.[14, 31, 32, 54, 55] are followed. Since √s0 represents the energy scale at which the\ncontinuum contribution begins, it should be slightly larger than the ground-state hadron\nmassm X, i.e.,√s0 ∼m X +δ ,where the typical value ofδlies within 0.4–0.8 GeV [14, 49, 56].\nWithin this range ofs 0, a suitable range ofM B in which the curve ofm X/λX −M 2\nB remains\nas stable and linear as possible can be searched. The overlapping region ofs 0 andM B\nobtained in this way defines the Borel window, which corresponds to the physically allowed\nparameter space for the hadronic state under investigation. In practice, an uncertainty of\nabout±0.1 GeV for √s0 is allowed, while the range ofM 2\nB should exceed 0.5 GeV2 to ensure\n10sufficient stability of the Borel window.\nAs a result, six possible independent hexaquark states can be obtained. These include one\n0+ state and two 1+ states corresponding to the Type-I currents, as well as one 0− state and\ntwo 1− states corresponding to the Type-II currents. For the other eight hexaquark states,\nno stable Borel window can be found regardless of the variation ofs 0 andM B, indicating\nthat the chosen interpolating currents do not couple well to the corresponding hexaquark\nconfigurations. The relevant numerical results are summarized in Table.II.

DECAY MODES ANALYSES\nIn realistic experimental environments, the observed hadronic states are usually not pure\nstates, but rather mixtures of several hadrons with nearly degenerate masses and identi-\ncal quantum numbers (such asJ P and strange numbers). To distinguish these states, it\nis essential to analyze their decay patterns. In this section, the possible decay modes of\nthe hexaquark states obtained in our calculations are provided, with the expectation that\nongoing experiments such as BESIII and Belle-II may be able to search for them.\n11The dominant strong decay channels are summarized in Table.III. Since the central values\nof the calculated hexaquark masses lie below the thresholds ofp ¯Λ andp ¯Σ, decays into these\ntwo baryons are forbidden. However, once uncertainties are taken into account, theJ P = 1−\nhexaquark states may allow for such decay channels. Therefore, these two decay patterns\nare also listed in parentheses in Table.III. Furthermore, thep ¯Λ andp ¯Σ molecular state is\nmore prone to directly decay intop+ ¯Λ orp+ ¯Σ, because it consists of two loosely bound\nbaryon-antibaryon clusters, and thus is less stable compared to the compact hexaquark state.\nDecays into three-meson final states are expected to dominate [14, 19], since the thresholds\nof these final states are smaller than the masses of hexaquark states. In addition, these\ntwo types of hexaquark configurations can also undergo weak decays, such as transitions to\na nucleon–antinucleon pairN ¯N. However, such processes involve the Cabibbo-suppressed\ntransitions→u, making them much more difficult to observe compared to the strong\ndecays.\ns0 =2.8 GeV\ns0 =2.9 GeV\ns0 =3.0 GeV\n2.4 2.5 2.6 2.7 2.8 2.9\n0.0\n0.2\n0.4\n0.6\n0.8\n1.0\nMB\n2(GeV2)\nR0+\nPC [3c]qqq-[3c]\n_\nqqs\n(a)\ns0 =2.8 GeV\ns0 =2.9 GeV\ns0 =3.0 GeV\n2.4 2.5 2.6 2.7 2.8 2.9\n0.020\n0.025\n0.030\n0.035\n0.040\n0.045\n0.050\n0.055\n0.060\nMB\n2(GeV2)\nR0+\nOPE [3c]qqq-[3c]\n_\nqqs (b)\ns0 =2.8 GeV\ns0 =2.9 GeV\ns0 =3.0 GeV\n2.4 2.5 2.6 2.7 2.8 2.9\n1.8\n1.9\n2.0\n2.1\n2.2\nMB\n2(GeV2)\nM0+\n[3c]qqq-[3c]\n_\nqqs\n(GeV)\n(c)\ns0 =2.8 GeV\ns0 =2.9 GeV\ns0 =3.0 GeV\n2.4 2.5 2.6 2.7 2.8 2.9\n0.000020\n0.000025\n0.000030\n0.000035\n0.000040\nMB\n2(GeV2)\nλ0+\n[3c]qqq-[3c]\n_\nqqs\n(GeV8) (d)\nFIG. 1: The figures forJ P = 0+ [3c]qqq -[¯3c]qqs (or [3c]qqq -[¯3c]qsq) hexaquark states.\n12s0 =2.8 GeV\ns0 =2.9 GeV\ns0 =3.0 GeV\n2.3 2.4 2.5 2.6 2.7 2.8 2.9 3.0\n0.0\n0.2\n0.4\n0.6\n0.8\n1.0\nMB\n2(GeV2)\nR1+\nPC [3c]qqq-[3c]\n_\nqqs\n(a)\ns0 =2.8 GeV\ns0 =2.9 GeV\ns0 =3.0 GeV\n2.3 2.4 2.5 2.6 2.7 2.8 2.9 3.0\n0.020\n0.025\n0.030\n0.035\n0.040\n0.045\n0.050\n0.055\n0.060\nMB\n2(GeV2)\nR1+\nOPE [3c]qqq-[3c]\n_\nqqs (b)\ns0 =2.8 GeV\ns0 =2.9 GeV\ns0 =3.0 GeV\n2.3 2.4 2.5 2.6 2.7 2.8 2.9 3.0\n1.8\n1.9\n2.0\n2.1\n2.2\nMB\n2(GeV2)\nM1+\n[3c]qqq-[3c]\n_\nqqs\n(GeV)\n(c)\ns0 =2.8 GeV\ns0 =2.9 GeV\ns0 =3.0 GeV\n2.3 2.4 2.5 2.6 2.7 2.8 2.9 3.0\n0.00001\n0.00002\n0.00003\n0.00004\n0.00005\n0.00006\nMB\n2(GeV2)\nλ1+\n[3c]qqq-[3c]\n_\nqqs\n(GeV8) (d)\nFIG. 2: The figures forJ P = 1+ [3c]qqq -[¯3c]qqs hexaquark state.\ns0 =2.8 GeV\ns0 =2.9 GeV\ns0 =3.0 GeV\n2.3 2.4 2.5 2.6 2.7 2.8 2.9\n0.0\n0.2\n0.4\n0.6\n0.8\n1.0\nMB\n2(GeV2)\nR1+\nPC [3c]qqq-[3c]\n_\nqsq\n(a)\ns0 =2.8 GeV\ns0 =2.9 GeV\ns0 =3.0 GeV\n2.3 2.4 2.5 2.6 2.7 2.8 2.9\n0.00\n0.01\n0.02\n0.03\n0.04\n0.05\n0.06\nMB\n2(GeV2)\nR1+\nOPE [3c]qqq-[3c]\n_\nqsq (b)\ns0 =2.8 GeV\ns0 =2.9 GeV\ns0 =3.0 GeV\n2.3 2.4 2.5 2.6 2.7 2.8 2.9\n1.8\n1.9\n2.0\n2.1\n2.2\nMB\n2(GeV2)\nM1+\n[3c]qqq-[3c]\n_\nqsq\n(GeV)\n(c)\ns0 =2.8 GeV\ns0 =2.9 GeV\ns0 =3.0 GeV\n2.3 2.4 2.5 2.6 2.7 2.8 2.9\n0.00001\n0.00002\n0.00003\n0.00004\n0.00005\nMB\n2(GeV2)\nλ1+\n[3c]qqq-[3c]\n_\nqsq\n(GeV8) (d)\nFIG. 3: The figures forJ P = 1+ [3c]qqq -[¯3c]qsq hexaquark states.\n13s0 =2.7 GeV\ns0 =2.8 GeV\ns0 =2.9 GeV\n1.6 1.7 1.8 1.9 2.0 2.1 2.2\n0.0\n0.2\n0.4\n0.6\n0.8\n1.0\nMB\n2(GeV2)\nR0-\nPC [3c]qqq-[3c]\n_\nqqs\n(a)\ns0 =2.7 GeV\ns0 =2.8 GeV\ns0 =2.9 GeV\n1.6 1.7 1.8 1.9 2.0 2.1 2.2\n0.00\n0.01\n0.02\n0.03\n0.04\nMB\n2(GeV2)\nR0-\nOPE [3c]qqq-[3c]\n_\nqqs (b)\ns0 =2.7 GeV\ns0 =2.8 GeV\ns0 =2.9 GeV\n1.6 1.7 1.8 1.9 2.0 2.1 2.2\n1.0\n1.5\n2.0\n2.5\n3.0\nMB\n2(GeV2)\nM0-\n[3c]qqq-[3c]\n_\nqqs\n(GeV)\n(c)\ns0 =2.7 GeV\ns0 =2.8 GeV\ns0 =2.9 GeV\n1.6 1.7 1.8 1.9 2.0 2.1 2.2\n0.00002\n0.00004\n0.00006\n0.00008\n0.00010\nMB\n2(GeV2)\nλ0-\n[3c]qqq-[3c]\n_\nqqs\n(GeV8) (d)\nFIG. 4: The figures forJ P = 0− [3c]qqq -[¯3c]qqs (or [3c]qqq -[¯3c]qsq) hexaquark states.\ns0 =2.8 GeV\ns0 =2.9 GeV\ns0 =3.0 GeV\n1.8 1.9 2.0 2.1 2.2 2.3\n0.0\n0.2\n0.4\n0.6\n0.8\n1.0\nMB\n2(GeV2)\nR1-\nPC [3c]qqq-[3c]\n_\nqqs\n(a)\ns0 =2.8 GeV\ns0 =2.9 GeV\ns0 =3.0 GeV\n1.8 1.9 2.0 2.1 2.2 2.3\n0.00\n0.02\n0.04\n0.06\n0.08\n0.10\nMB\n2(GeV2)\nR1-\nOPE [3c]qqq-[3c]\n_\nqqs (b)\ns0 =2.8 GeV\ns0 =2.9 GeV\ns0 =3.0 GeV\n1.8 1.9 2.0 2.1 2.2 2.3\n1.0\n1.5\n2.0\n2.5\n3.0\nMB\n2(GeV2)\nM1-\n[3c]qqq-[3c]\n_\nqqs\n(GeV)\n(c)\ns0 =2.8 GeV\ns0 =2.9 GeV\ns0 =3.0 GeV\n1.8 1.9 2.0 2.1 2.2 2.3\n0.00002\n0.00004\n0.00006\n0.00008\n0.00010\nMB\n2(GeV2)\nλ1-\n[3c]qqq-[3c]\n_\nqqs\n(GeV8) (d)\nFIG. 5: The figures forJ P = 1− [3c]qqq -[¯3c]qqs hexaquark state.\n14s0 =2.8 GeV\ns0 =2.9 GeV\ns0 =3.0 GeV\n1.8 1.9 2.0 2.1 2.2 2.3\n0.0\n0.2\n0.4\n0.6\n0.8\n1.0\nMB\n2(GeV2)\nR1-\nPC [3c]qqq-[3c]\n_\nqsq\n(a)\ns0 =2.8 GeV\ns0 =2.9 GeV\ns0 =3.0 GeV\n1.8 1.9 2.0 2.1 2.2 2.3\n0.00\n0.01\n0.02\n0.03\n0.04\n0.05\nMB\n2(GeV2)\nR1-\nOPE [3c]qqq-[3c]\n_\nqsq (b)\ns0 =2.8 GeV\ns0 =2.9 GeV\ns0 =3.0 GeV\n1.8 1.9 2.0 2.1 2.2 2.3\n1.0\n1.5\n2.0\n2.5\n3.0\nMB\n2(GeV2)\nM1-\n[3c]qqq-[3c]\n_\nqsq\n(GeV)\n(c)\ns0 =2.8 GeV\ns0 =2.9 GeV\ns0 =3.0 GeV\n1.8 1.9 2.0 2.1 2.2 2.3\n0.00002\n0.00004\n0.00006\n0.00008\n0.00010\nMB\n2(GeV2)\nλ1-\n[3c]qqq-[3c]\n_\nqsq\n(GeV8) (d)\nFIG. 6: The figures forJ P = 1− [3c]qqq -[¯3c]qsq hexaquark states.\nJP 0− 0+ 1− 1+\n[3c]qqq -[¯3c]qqs ππK,ωωK ππK ∗,ωωK ∗ ππK ∗,ωωK ∗ ππK ∗,ωωK ∗\nπρK πρK(p ¯Λ/p¯Σ)πρK\n[3c]qqq -[¯3c]qsq ππK,ωωK ππK ∗,ωωK ∗ ππK ∗,ωωK ∗ ππK ∗,ωωK ∗\nπρK πρK(p ¯Λ/p¯Σ)πρK\nTABLE III: Typical decay modes of the hexaquark states for each quantum number.\nV. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS\nIn this work, we explore the compact hexaquark states constructed from two different\ntriquark currents, in which the only two possible configurations, [3 c]qqq -[¯3c]qqs and [3 c]qqq -\n[¯3c]qsq with quantum numbersJ P = 0 −,0 +,1 −,1 + are taken into account. Their masses\nand decay constants are calculated within the QCDSR framework. The results indicate\nthe probable existence of six independent hexaquark states. The possible decay modes of\nthese six hexaquark states are analyzed, including both strong and weak decay channels.\n15These predicted decay patterns provide a theoretical basis for their potential identification\nin ongoing experiments such as BESIII and Belle-II.\nPhenomenologically, one can find that the mass ofX(2075) lies within the predicted range\nof theJ P = 1− hexaquark states in [3c]qqq -[¯3c]qqs and [3c]qqq -[¯3c]qsq configurations, suggesting\nthatX(2075) may contain such hexaquark components. In contrast, the mass ofX(2085)\ndoes not fall into the predicted region for theJ P = 1+ hexaquark states considered here,\nimplying that its internal structure cannot be explained by the present configurations alone.\nTo clarify the nature ofX(2085), a more comprehensive analysis is desirable that includes a\nmixture of interpolating currents in Eqs. (7)–(8) and other possible configurations, such as\ncurrents in Ref. [19]. Moreover, the two compact hexaquark states predicted in this work\nwith quantum numbersJ P = 0+ andJ P = 0− can serve as candidate for the open strange\nhadrons near 2 GeV.\nFinally, this study provides a further theoretical insight to the spectroscopy of multiquark\nsystem. The molecular and multiquark structures may coexist, which pose a challenge to us\nin deciphering the exotic states.\nAcknowledgments\nThis work was supported in part by the National Key Research and Development Pro-\ngram of China under Contracts No. 2020YFA0406400, by the National Natural Science\nFoundation of China(NSFC) under the Grants 12475087 and 12235008.\n[1] S.
