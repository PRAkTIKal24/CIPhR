  "What is the main physics phenomenon studied by this paper": "The paper studies the detection of ultra-high-energy (UHE) particles of cosmic origin, particularly UHE cosmic rays and their secondary particles (gamma rays and neutrinos), by observing the radio signals from air showers they produce in the atmosphere.",
  "Is this work related to dark matter searches? If yes, how?": "No, this work is not directly related to dark matter searches. The paper focuses on detecting neutrinos and cosmic rays to understand their cosmic origins.",
  "Does this paper present experimental results? If yes, what is the name of the experimental apparatus?": "Yes, the paper presents initial results from prototype arrays. The names of the experimental apparatuses are GRAND@Nan\c{c}ay, GRAND@Auger, and GRANDProto300."

  "What is the main physics phenomenon studied by this paper": "The main physics phenomenon studied is the direct detection of dark matter particles, specifically searching for low-mass dark matter.",
  "Is this work related to dark matter searches? If yes, how?": "Yes, this work is directly related to dark matter searches. It reports results from the CRESST-III experiment, which is designed for the direct detection of dark matter particles, and it sets new limits on the cross-section for low-mass dark matter particles.",
  "Does this paper present experimental results? If yes, what is the name of the experimental apparatus?": "Yes, the paper presents experimental results. The name of the experimental apparatus is the CRESST-III experiment."

  "What is the main physics phenomenon studied by this paper": "This paper studies the annual and diurnal rate modulations of dark matter signals. This is a key signature expected from the interaction of dark matter particles with a detector on Earth, as the Earth's velocity relative to the dark matter halo changes due to its rotation and orbit around the Sun.",
  "Is this work related to dark matter searches? If yes, how?": "Yes, this work is directly related to dark matter searches. It analyzes data from the XENON1T experiment to look for evidence of dark matter in the form of Weakly Interacting Massive Particles (WIMPs). The search focuses on identifying time-varying signals that would distinguish a dark matter signal from background noise.",
  "Does this paper present experimental results? If yes, what is the name of the experimental apparatus?": "Yes, this paper presents experimental results. The name of the experimental apparatus is XENON1T."

{
  "What is the main physics phenomenon studied by this paper": "The paper describes a search for axion-like particles (ALPs) by detecting their interaction with nuclear spins. The experiment looks for a precession of nuclear spins that would be induced by the presence of an ALP field.",
  "Is this work related to dark matter searches? If yes, how?": "Yes, this work is directly related to dark matter searches. The abstract and introduction of the paper state that axion-like particles are a well-motivated candidate for dark matter, and the CASPEr experiment is designed to detect these particles.",
  "Does this paper present experimental results? If yes, what is the name of the experimental apparatus?": "Yes, the paper presents experimental results, specifically new limits on the coupling of axion-like particles to nucleons. The name of the experimental apparatus is CASPEr (Cosmic Axion Spin Precession Experiment)."

  "What is the main physics phenomenon studied by this paper": "The main phenomenon is the directional detection of nuclear recoils. The paper explores techniques to measure the 3D direction of a nucleus after it has been struck by another particle, which is crucial for distinguishing signal from background in certain particle searches.",
  "Is this work related to dark matter searches? If yes, how?": "Yes, this work is directly related to dark matter searches. It aims to detect Weakly Interacting Massive Particles (WIMPs), a leading dark matter candidate, by measuring the direction of WIMP-induced nuclear recoils. Since the WIMP signal is expected to have a specific directional signature (coming from the direction of the Cygnus constellation), this technique can provide strong evidence for a dark matter discovery and distinguish it from isotropic backgrounds.",
  "Does this paper present experimental results? If yes, what is the name of the experimental apparatus?": "Yes, the paper presents experimental results from a prototype detector. The experimental apparatus is named a "low-pressure negative ion time projection chamber" (NITPC)."
